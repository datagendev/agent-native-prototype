the weissy partner Toa Clavis just Diana.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah.\nWilliam Lee: That is all.\nyusheng kuo: So you need test automation.\nWilliam Lee: Gotcha.\nWilliam Lee: Co founder.\nWilliam Lee: Oh, like yeah.\nWilliam Lee: Tell me what you did.\nWilliam Lee: Blah blah.\nWilliam Lee: Bloomberg decentralized exchange venture studio angel invest to teams to build certain projects.\nWilliam Lee: How much did you raise for that?\nWilliam Lee: And how 600k for the decentralized exchange.\nWilliam Lee: You know 600k is not enough to run a venture studio, right?\nWilliam Lee: No, no.\nWilliam Lee: Like to explain.\nWilliam Lee: The 600k was for our decentralized exchange.\nWilliam Lee: And then we made a lot of money from that.\nWilliam Lee: And then like the.\nWilliam Lee: The profit we made from that, we used it to run a venture studio.\nWilliam Lee: Now, have you personally angel invested in anything?\nWilliam Lee: Yes.\nWilliam Lee: How much have you personally invested?\nWilliam Lee: You're letting people know your net worth.\nWilliam Lee: No, Diana.\nWilliam Lee: Joe, take it as a sign that like he's lying or something.\nWilliam Lee: Just so like how much did you angel invest yourself?\nWilliam Lee: No, no, no.\nWilliam Lee: Hold on.\nWilliam Lee: Reluctantly.\nWilliam Lee: So how.\nWilliam Lee: How much liquidity did you have from crypto overall?\nWilliam Lee: Yo, like dude, this is none of your business.\nWilliam Lee: Like you shut the up.\nWilliam Lee: We really like the team but we're not sure about the use case of the product you're building.\nWilliam Lee: If you can land a pilot in one week, we'd love to interview you again next weekend.\nWilliam Lee: MCP doesn't exist yet.\nWilliam Lee: You're a woman we're building in that space.\nWilliam Lee: So like no one knows who composite was.\nWilliam Lee: Right, right, right.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah but it's like infrastructure that eventually everyone expected to exist.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Hesitate.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: What will be the future Authentication dedicated AI agent I probably wouldn't use mcp.\nyusheng kuo: I would just like build rapper like myself like highly tailored like description latency server local client called server okay then support agent coding agent coding agent but same with the tool retrieval tool can deploy on mcp.\nyusheng kuo: Would you how code the sub agent creation process could potentially be the future of how agent be created for everyone to create code to create something.\nyusheng kuo: Then Kyle co the sub agent how the UI get in the IOR now Theoretical It's a primitive founder Codex Gemini cli and quite abuse when the personal assistant with transient compute milk resistant storage spin out whole VN technical deploy he changed out you got API call HTTP okay need a file system the code environment Sorry the code interpreter need a part of your environment has it should be part of like a tool interpreter Hasika tool has talent environment now.\nWilliam Lee: In my opinion the future agent in general and automation clockhole sub agent now just needs to declare the set of tools and what model you use Coding agent that you got going sooner home.\nyusheng kuo: How to spell it?\nWilliam Lee: What was I.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nWilliam Lee: Just a face on focus on spec driven development in my honest opinion in my honest opinion both will exist anyway.\nWilliam Lee: From my perspective it's what do you want to trade off in terms of brittleness Natural language to code automation flow generate this whole bug but it's a one time thing.\nWilliam Lee: Once you fix it hypothetically the automation product do you create it should function just as expected deterministically until some API gets deprecated or gets changed or something else breaks then process deterministic robust just had generated an outcome.\nyusheng kuo: To me.\nWilliam Lee: Spec driven development clock code sub agent do something like maybe in the future it's not even.\nWilliam Lee: It's not even code it's just like you just write a piece of natural language to ensure that the agent does this thing for you.\nWilliam Lee: It's like an article within your can the article non deterministic temperature you set to zero the guardrail to the two call parameter generation and everything the chances of failure for that particular action is still going to be like orders of magnitude higher than it was executed through code.\nWilliam Lee: So exactly to your point when it's something that is like repetitive but it's not like super high repetition repeat.\nWilliam Lee: No Judah like the spec driven development Spec driven automation makes a lot of sense.\nWilliam Lee: You just need to make sure that it works a thousand times with a 99.99 probability internal.\nWilliam Lee: When there's more flexibility latency matters less.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah, that makes a ton of sense.\nWilliam Lee: No, it's like a sandbox like for the execute for the execution environment.\nWilliam Lee: Should that be just part of the agent itself and the environment that the agent is in or should it be like a tool?\nWilliam Lee: I think it would be both like to be very honest.\nWilliam Lee: Oh yeah, you call it as a tool whatever.\nWilliam Lee: No, you can execute the Python code you generate.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah, I think that makes sense.\nWilliam Lee: Well actually is not a good example Interface with other production software self contained a sandbox so in my opinion security the perspective environment you can call as a tool like anyway.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah so I think it just completely depends on the use case.\nWilliam Lee: The last thing I wanted to say just she's a woman so you go by your light woman released like a 22 so she's a trading application.\nWilliam Lee: So we're actually not where we haven't been dealing that much directly with NCP vertical agent.\nyusheng kuo: Eventually need a manifestation agent that eventually will hide out to build an agent so people can feel the value.\nyusheng kuo: Otherwise like there's no value.\nyusheng kuo: There's no like immediate observable value.\nWilliam Lee: Exactly it's so hard to prove roi.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nWilliam Lee: ROI is so clear.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Like so straightforward.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nWilliam Lee: I sold 200,000 tickets for you this year, so you pay me $200,000.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nWilliam Lee: Doesn't MCP like when you're a middleware.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, we're middleware for sure.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nWilliam Lee: Oh, it's gonna improve your developer productivity.\nWilliam Lee: Do you measure that?\nWilliam Lee: No.\nWilliam Lee: Once you measure it, everyone and their grandmother wants a slice of the metric.\nWilliam Lee: Just its own PM the director of engineering.\nWilliam Lee: No, no, no.\nWilliam Lee: Like yeah, the MCB helped a bit but it was my policy or my management.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's like so hard to position because you couldn't position to dev dev developer tool.\nyusheng kuo: Not really.\nyusheng kuo: Because like dead people were like, oh I would just like develop my own like MCB tool if it's like only few of them.\nyusheng kuo: And then it's also hard to put into the entry price perspective because who am I now?\nyusheng kuo: So it's the third enterprise now vendor.\nyusheng kuo: The vendor.\nyusheng kuo: The Tigong.\nyusheng kuo: The MCP level on top of.\nyusheng kuo: Doesn't make sense for middleware to do that and then.\nyusheng kuo: But what makes sense is actually the vendor needs to like do it.\nWilliam Lee: So you're building it from scratch.\nWilliam Lee: So like he went through the whole.\nWilliam Lee: Whole thing.\nWilliam Lee: Same thing.\nWilliam Lee: Integration software.\nWilliam Lee: Open source is IPO salesforce Billion.\nWilliam Lee: So going home.\nWilliam Lee: That's what I said.\nWilliam Lee: Like was it this difficult for you as well?\nWilliam Lee: He said yes.\nWilliam Lee: Just like IMO young, like he had to go through the same, you know, kind of.\nWilliam Lee: It's a good journey.\nWilliam Lee: Just it has to.\nyusheng kuo: It should be the same.\nyusheng kuo: It should be almost exactly the same.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah, it was a 10 year journey for him like before he actually got to got to the IPO and the exit and everything now that's it.\nWilliam Lee: So yes, just like building more in the application layer.\nWilliam Lee: AI data analyst actually still makes a lot of sense.\nWilliam Lee: Specifically like one specific type of data analysis that is like very difficult to do.\nWilliam Lee: Like all the stuff that you've already built and all the learning that you've done do that.\nWilliam Lee: I think it's like at least.\nyusheng kuo: They.\nWilliam Lee: Tried Intercom, they tried Decagon Sierra, but that didn't work for them.\nWilliam Lee: Custom integration.\nWilliam Lee: You said custom domain knowledge something but they want something.\nWilliam Lee: It's just like the existing solutions just doesn't work.\nWilliam Lee: Now.\nyusheng kuo: How do you scale not to be like almost like consultant and studio.\nyusheng kuo: How do you draw the line there?\nyusheng kuo: Which.\nWilliam Lee: Is a specific niche.\nWilliam Lee: Just in short, reusable components for other players in this industry doesn't make an industry very limited.\nWilliam Lee: But at the same time it also makes it very easy to validate whether you want to do it.\nWilliam Lee: Then just reach out to 12 companies.\nWilliam Lee: If all of them say off then you can just.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nWilliam Lee: In three days you can just, you can just move on.\nWilliam Lee: It's double edged sword.\nWilliam Lee: Long term customer supporting.\nWilliam Lee: Starting point going to.\nWilliam Lee: How do you operationalize institutional knowledge?\nWilliam Lee: No one can replicate it.\nWilliam Lee: Institutional knowledge, it's not even written down.\nWilliam Lee: You don't even know.\nWilliam Lee: You don't even know like this until, until you, you've seen it like on the factory floor.\nWilliam Lee: How do you capture that.\nyusheng kuo: Repetitive pattern that happens Also they portray as like a tribal knowledge.\nWilliam Lee: Right.\nyusheng kuo: There's also memory PowerPoint and your record is super messy.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: This is discovery enterprise level.\nyusheng kuo: It doesn't make sense to be living in md.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Like how diversion control.\nyusheng kuo: You give version everything.\nyusheng kuo: No.\nyusheng kuo: How do you handle the conflict?\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nWilliam Lee: Management the solution.\nWilliam Lee: Like to your point, he's very not bullish on Asian Ops.\nWilliam Lee: You only have to look at the historical outcome for ML Ops to see like there was like practically no company in ML Ops that like was like that big unicorn and that like that, that's like.\nyusheng kuo: Like big market cicd.\nWilliam Lee: Like what does it.\nWilliam Lee: Why can't you use existing tools for that Customer support Asian rag pipeline to the internal documentation.\nWilliam Lee: Documentation update just embedding and everything.\nWilliam Lee: Since it's just running a CI cd.\nWilliam Lee: So the moment they trigger an update to their documentation, you also trigger a new set of embedding action.\nWilliam Lee: Chunking embedding action.\nWilliam Lee: So it took a while.\nWilliam Lee: Like okay, like it's trivial.\nWilliam Lee: The whole agent operating procedure.\nWilliam Lee: Literally the system prom a set of instructions that has to follow retrieve those steps.\nWilliam Lee: Existing sop.\nWilliam Lee: You should do it this way.\nWilliam Lee: You should do it this way.\nWilliam Lee: So now the only thing we're doing is we're cleaning it up into a markdown file.\nWilliam Lee: Now you're feeding it, we're feeding it as a tool call.\nWilliam Lee: So just every time the SOP gets updated, the AOP also gets updated.\nWilliam Lee: And then whenever the agent needs an aop it's only retrieving it.\nWilliam Lee: It's just retrieving it as a tool.\nWilliam Lee: So it just has the most up to date information anyway.\nWilliam Lee: The system to us we didn't find the need to redesign a database from the ground up for the agent itself.\nWilliam Lee: Baseline system prompt customer query retrieval.\nWilliam Lee: There's no relevant aop.\nWilliam Lee: Now when you get default behavior for like this is a loop you need to go through.\nWilliam Lee: It's also still just like updated directly through md.\nWilliam Lee: Under what circumstance would you need a Kind of like living, almost like living document.\nWilliam Lee: Like that part can either be done through tool or just like repeated deployment.\nWilliam Lee: Like for us we feel like actually most agents it's okay to yo eat the Indian just say like some small break before it's like updated continuously.\nWilliam Lee: Asian memory solution they're really focused on like oh bring your context with one existing Asian interaction into your next new agent interaction.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nWilliam Lee: Then like there are situations that you need that.\nWilliam Lee: So like when people use MEM0 like what is the.\nWilliam Lee: Like what's the ROI?\nWilliam Lee: It reduces your token usage.\nWilliam Lee: No, that's the completely wrong logic.\nWilliam Lee: When I use a memory solution I don't, I'm not like I shouldn't be.\nWilliam Lee: I shouldn't be using a memory solution to reduce token usage priority.\nWilliam Lee: I'm not sure that memory hasn't really landed yet.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I don't think any of Asian memory are a real memory.\nyusheng kuo: They are more like just still like a retrieval thing in the end of the day.\nyusheng kuo: You know co interpreter context engineering service engineering external persistent storage interaction File system.\nWilliam Lee: Can be both like self contained file system.\nWilliam Lee: The stuff is like ephemeral long living the file like outside of that can also interact with persistent file storage systems that are online enterprise like infrastructure.\nyusheng kuo: Had interrupt now the multi thread.\nWilliam Lee: Interrupt some.\nyusheng kuo: Movement disappear how long like what's the lifetime Internal memory that has a shorthand.\nWilliam Lee: Ultimately we, we think it's depend.\nWilliam Lee: It's up to the agent designer to decide middle word design.\nWilliam Lee: Some handle to calling the national log as in their home.\nWilliam Lee: So the decision we came to was as a piece of dev tool or middleware you want to be as neutral as possible while still maintaining developer experience.\nWilliam Lee: You have to be opinionated about some stuff opinionators.\nWilliam Lee: So actually it makes your tool very difficult less useful.\nWilliam Lee: It should be up to the agent.\nWilliam Lee: Development also highly depends on the kind of agent you're designing.\nWilliam Lee: Agent persistent agent so you can just start A lot of times you just start a new conversation.\nWilliam Lee: So like when you wipe that it like makes a lot of sense.\nWilliam Lee: Personal assistant agent it connects with your gmail, connects with your slack, blah blah unifies all your message streams to imessage.\nWilliam Lee: So hey here's a summary of like all the messages.\nWilliam Lee: Rolling persistence automatically clear something out but you keep like a rolling memory of the last X number of hours or X number of whatever.\nWilliam Lee: But it's up to the agent developer to decide how they want to abstract that in my opinion.\nWilliam Lee: Right, right.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah I think, I think that's a very good point.\nyusheng kuo: Like like you provide the tool everything just a tool and then the age like if you do have an access for the developer to kind of decide whether they.\nyusheng kuo: How they want to do it and then they kind of play around the limitation you provide.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Maybe.\nyusheng kuo: I. I haven't.\nyusheng kuo: I haven't like running into like like a deep deep way more than governance Engineering the tooling context engineering the toolbox.\nyusheng kuo: She managed soil MCP.\nWilliam Lee: Directionally.\nWilliam Lee: That.\nWilliam Lee: That definitely makes sense.\nWilliam Lee: Existing middleware company postman like middle word unicorn hard to crack.\nWilliam Lee: There's definitely a lot of value here and I still think there's a lot of value in middleware.\nWilliam Lee: Okay, let's retreat to.\nWilliam Lee: That's the sad part.\nWilliam Lee: That's the sad part.\nyusheng kuo: That's a real developer like agent developer won't use mcp.\nWilliam Lee: No.\nyusheng kuo: It just doesn't make a lot of sense on demand configuration.\nyusheng kuo: It's a worthy investment to invest in the tool to fully optimize.\nyusheng kuo: Exactly.\nWilliam Lee: To be honest I. I think it's a tarpit at some point it won't be a tar pit but I think it's still in the tarpit phase in my.\nWilliam Lee: In my opinion.\nyusheng kuo: Enjoy personal automation.\nyusheng kuo: None of them work out like Lucha fail cowork.\nyusheng kuo: I don't pessimistic on that.\nWilliam Lee: Anyway this is my my take.\nWilliam Lee: It's the right answer.\nWilliam Lee: Vast vast majority of people male no Monk, what the.\nWilliam Lee: You need a personal assistant founder Even when we're a pre seed.\nWilliam Lee: Hey, we're getting 200k the personal assistant.\nWilliam Lee: Like managing the calendar.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah.\nWilliam Lee: It'S just like why the would you need it?\nWilliam Lee: It's like it doesn't actually save you that much time.\nWilliam Lee: Oh you're the CEO of Vercel Priorit.\nWilliam Lee: Someday.\nWilliam Lee: Someday like there will be some like some digital personal assistant good enough for these people to care about.\nWilliam Lee: Daily average Joe 9 to 5 Instagram TikTok.\nWilliam Lee: Like why the does he need a personal assistant?\nWilliam Lee: Like why like what would this person use the personal assistant for?\nWilliam Lee: Yeah, like that's actually the main issue with the idea.\nWilliam Lee: Even if you're targeting professional white collar consultants, investment bankers, lawyers like personal assistant research.\nWilliam Lee: I have a research assistant but it doesn't need to be a general personal assistant.\nWilliam Lee: It just has to be a research assistant because it just has to be a PowerPoint assistant organization.\nWilliam Lee: It's just like there's no use case for it.\nyusheng kuo: Which I don't think that's useful at all.\nWilliam Lee: Agree with you then.\nWilliam Lee: So mcp like the first early adopters of MCP were developers.\nWilliam Lee: Workaholic.\nWilliam Lee: The perspective.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: We're biased.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah yeah.\nWilliam Lee: So just A mcp send it all down mainstream.\nWilliam Lee: Just your everyday consumer will care about this thing or will see ROI from this.\nWilliam Lee: So when MCP is combined with entertainment.\nyusheng kuo: Oh okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nWilliam Lee: That's when the big blow up will happen.\nWilliam Lee: Entertainment it's very restricted to per platform algorithm.\nWilliam Lee: Don't see you get addicted.\nWilliam Lee: This is what Instagram does the same thing doing does the same thing the whole.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah, we're interested against sex.\nWilliam Lee: The opposite of dating.\nWilliam Lee: OB whatever the OB just again gambling.\nWilliam Lee: Yo Gwenda new experience doesn't just like out of 8.3 billion people.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nWilliam Lee: The net amount of people.\nWilliam Lee: Oh would you just show you guys.\nWilliam Lee: Digital art is so fun.\nyusheng kuo: It's like I never use me journey personally.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah.\nWilliam Lee: I mean I never use my advantage.\nWilliam Lee: I use other generation software.\nWilliam Lee: You know what is the future model?\nWilliam Lee: Just like in my opinion just maybe you get to a point where your hodu entertainment site they'll offer external facing MCP now somehow your personal agent can just go and collect the shit that it knows you'll be interested in for when you get off work at 5.\nWilliam Lee: Oh no.\nWilliam Lee: Like the moment that happens is like personal agents will.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah.\nWilliam Lee: That's just what the hypothesis obviously what an opinion probably that's where personal assistance will really come in like mainstream.\nyusheng kuo: Touch swipe left or right?\nyusheng kuo: Just swipe up right.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: This is the only signal you can get.\nyusheng kuo: The only UI you can day connection.\nyusheng kuo: That's how the moderns of society like work.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah but like everything is just dopamine.\nyusheng kuo: Like optimized like function is dopamine.\nWilliam Lee: Just compete for attention.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah, yeah yeah exactly.\nyusheng kuo: I billboard everything like all the slogan like that's how you win.\nWilliam Lee: Prediction market.\nWilliam Lee: Prediction market with leverage.\nyusheng kuo: Oh so dumb.\nWilliam Lee: I'll send you.\nWilliam Lee: So maybe what we should build is like a perpetual prediction market.\nWilliam Lee: Just perpetual options equity demand making option contractors autosity with defined endpoint options.\nWilliam Lee: Okay young Joe.\nWilliam Lee: We should do a perpetual prediction market with leverage open your contract.\nWilliam Lee: So need to like whether the wind decentralized exchange perpetual decentralization hyper liquid annual revenue over 1 billion.\nyusheng kuo: 1 billion.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah yeah.\nWilliam Lee: $100 million per person is insane.\nWilliam Lee: Holy crap.\nWilliam Lee: It's like.\nWilliam Lee: I don't know.\nyusheng kuo: Gambling, dating, like.\nyusheng kuo: Like sex.\nyusheng kuo: Like.\nyusheng kuo: Like a 17.\nyusheng kuo: Just focusing on 17 everything is like improving human will not work out.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah yeah but.\nyusheng kuo: But yeah it's yeah it's well don't do app to inspire people.\nyusheng kuo: It never work out people is doing the job and make it job easier.\nyusheng kuo: Then that will work out.\nyusheng kuo: But inspire people.\nyusheng kuo: No, never.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nWilliam Lee: Rebrand some Turbo McPoy.\nyusheng kuo: Okay everything eventually if you are not a vendor that's the only value provided Area 0 sound again is it gateway but male compatibility.\nyusheng kuo: How can your vertical stack the compatibility?\nyusheng kuo: Because horizontal compatibility so sometime the gateway now in the gateway the feature middleware Middleware has a vertical.\nWilliam Lee: Just depending on the use cases.\nyusheng kuo: Maybe MCP is just not a good business to be.\nyusheng kuo: It's just going to be honest like just like that's it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah yeah.\nWilliam Lee: Since I were into agent building.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah I'll brainstorm the song Joe like ping me on.\nWilliam Lee: On what?\nWilliam Lee: Oh yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Thank you so much.\nyusheng kuo: Like you're the first source I was like okay I feel confused here whether I should stick on a brilliant MCP or we should more focusing on providing whole environment.\nyusheng kuo: So that's just from the dev experience perspective Develop a good cheer to enjoy experience deployment the production has been doesn't mean MCP use case by use case.\nyusheng kuo: It's really hard to tell.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: If you just like a simple chat then yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's like it's not necessary to spin our whole vn.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Everything can be interacted as a tool like a particular vn.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nWilliam Lee: Live in its own VM actually it makes the engineering harder as well.\nyusheng kuo: And then the security is hell.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah it's hell as well.\nyusheng kuo: Your product market fit no one yeah no one have a problem.\nyusheng kuo: No one is like people crazy about that.\nWilliam Lee: Well I well I can almost on the market just MCP3 million like in.\nyusheng kuo: Aggregate in my opinion Open source developers open source not in the revenue.\nWilliam Lee: There will be a day when it happens Marathon now eventually hit the gold mine.\nWilliam Lee: Psychological endurance.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah too many opportunity out there.\nWilliam Lee: Too many opportunities out there distractions.\nyusheng kuo: I'm just another just raising another 100 million being a sales AI sales people make another million.\nWilliam Lee: It will have its commercial moment like first principle.\nWilliam Lee: It just like makes sense.\nWilliam Lee: Something happened happens like not even MCP specifically.\nWilliam Lee: That's just a 2 falling in the middleware.\nWilliam Lee: That's just not now that's a now in my opinion just a pure psychological endurance.\nWilliam Lee: And you have to wait for the rest of the ecosystem to catch up as well.\nWilliam Lee: So every individual vendor also needs to actually play into the standard first party mcp.\nWilliam Lee: Now we have an MCP as well.\nWilliam Lee: But it's there's actually they don't have any.\nWilliam Lee: They don't put any effort into making them.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Like authentication for example.\nyusheng kuo: Like there's no authentication building.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Even even protocol itself can support it.\nyusheng kuo: Just don't spend time like yeah yeah yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's like kind of it's.\nyusheng kuo: It's.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Timing is.\nyusheng kuo: Is critical.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah right.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah yeah yeah but but at the.\nWilliam Lee: Same time the winner will be someone who emerged this wave just for like someone who stays a lot around long enough to eventually cracking you by the.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah but maybe not you've seen the Dongsi without baggage.\nWilliam Lee: It's I don't know.\nyusheng kuo: It's all right.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah it's not necessarily who's the first.\nyusheng kuo: One being in your wrist.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Because someone who may actually feel the pain more like more present pain.\nyusheng kuo: You know because sometimes you are the builder you try to create a pain.\nyusheng kuo: You don't try to fit yourself into the pain.\nyusheng kuo: You don't directly feel the pain but someone who like directly feel the pain and then come out with the solution actually that yeah.\nWilliam Lee: Co founder is it brought this up a few times.\nWilliam Lee: Yo when so the MCP gateways in there how I was like pushing the team to do it.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah like proactively dog food like how can we expect like other people to adopt.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Who doesn't feel the pain like it's just like yeah now oh just genius idea.\nyusheng kuo: It's unnecessary for most like 99 of your job validator.\nyusheng kuo: We kind of like already passed that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah yeah it's a good feature but it's not like a major feature at all.\nWilliam Lee: Cool.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah well keep it updated.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah sorry I take an hour.\nyusheng kuo: It should be supposed to be a 30 minute only.\nWilliam Lee: No.\nWilliam Lee: Did we take it?\nWilliam Lee: I don't think so.\nWilliam Lee: I thought we only took 30.\nWilliam Lee: Oh it's fine.\nWilliam Lee: No worries.\nyusheng kuo: Sorry.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah thank you.\nWilliam Lee: Well yeah.\nyusheng kuo: London as soon as possible.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah yeah.\nWilliam Lee: Will you be an SF anytime soon.\nyusheng kuo: Or let's see how how I see.\nWilliam Lee: Work out and yeah we'll try to.\nyusheng kuo: Try to discuss and I think we really need to get back like some real feedback and be honest with ourselves not because we invest like forget about the same cost.\nyusheng kuo: Right right.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nWilliam Lee: Applied albeit incubator.\nyusheng kuo: Now.\nWilliam Lee: Applied any opinion on the material just like hit me up.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Thanks a lot.\nWilliam Lee: All good man.\nWilliam Lee: Have a good one.\nWilliam Lee: Yeah take care.\nyusheng kuo: Bye bye.\nTitle: Yusheng Kuo and
