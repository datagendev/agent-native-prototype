  "error_type": "MCP_TOOLS_NOT_ACCESSIBLE",
  "error_message": "MCP tools (PostHog and Neon) are not directly accessible in this execution context. The agent requires access to mcp_Posthog_query_run and mcp_Neon_run_sql to collect real-time user activity data.",
  "workaround": "In a production environment, this agent would invoke MCP tools via the Claude Desktop integration to query PostHog analytics and Neon database directly.",

    "Attempted to invoke user-activity-tracker skill - skill invocation not available in current context",
    "Looked for alternative data collection methods",
    "Determined that MCP tool access is required for live data"
  ],
  "recommendation": "This scheduled task demonstrates the workflow structure. For full functionality, ensure the agent has access to MCP servers configured in Claude Desktop."
