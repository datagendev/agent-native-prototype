      That way I can point you to the most relevant features.

      Sorry to hear you're having trouble accessing your account. Let me help:

      1. Try resetting your password at https://app.datagen.dev/forgot-password
      2. If that doesn't work, let me know the email you signed up with and I'll look into it

      I'll follow up shortly with more details.
