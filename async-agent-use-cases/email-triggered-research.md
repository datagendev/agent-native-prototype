# Email-Triggered Research Sprint

Send email → research sprint → report generation → dashboard update.

## Problem

- Research requests pile up in inbox
- Manual research takes hours per request
- No systematic way to track research status
- Insights scattered across docs and threads

## Solution

Email-triggered async agent that:
1. Parses research request from email
2. Conducts multi-source research
3. Generates structured report
4. Updates tracking dashboard

## Trigger

```
Email to: research@company.com
Subject: [RESEARCH] Topic description
Body: Context, questions, deadline
```

## Pipeline

```
1. RECEIVE email via webhook
    ↓
2. PARSE request
   - Extract topic, questions, context
   - Identify requester, deadline
   - Classify research type
    ↓
3. PLAN research sprint
   - Identify sources to check
   - Define search queries
   - Set scope boundaries
    ↓
4. EXECUTE research (parallel where possible)
   - Web search for recent info
   - Internal docs search
   - Competitor sites
   - Industry reports
   - Social mentions
    ↓
5. SYNTHESIZE findings
   - Organize by question/theme
   - Identify key insights
   - Note confidence levels
   - Flag gaps
    ↓
6. GENERATE report
   - Executive summary
   - Detailed findings
   - Sources cited
   - Recommendations
    ↓
7. DELIVER
   - Email report to requester
   - Save to research archive
   - Update dashboard
   - Log for tracking
```
