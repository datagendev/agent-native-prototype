# Your AI Shouldn't Need You to Be There

**Connect your GitHub, select an agent, get a webhook. It runs when you're not looking.**

---

## The Shift: From "I Run Claude" to "Claude Runs For Me"

Claude Code is incredible—but today, every task starts with you typing a command in the CLI. Every workflow waits for you to hit enter. When you close your laptop, Claude closes too.

| Interactive Claude Code | DataGen Async Agents |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| You type a command in CLI | A webhook triggers the agent |
| Runs while you watch | Runs while you sleep |
| One task at a time | Thousands of events, handled automatically |
| Your laptop needs to be open | Runs in the cloud, 24/7 |

**Same Claude intelligence. Zero babysitting.**

## Why Build Your Agent in Claude Code?

You could write Python scripts. You could use no-code tools. But Claude Code is the fastest path from idea to production-ready agent.

### 1. Just Describe What You Want

No Python. No LangChain. No framework to learn.

Open Claude Code, describe your agent in plain English, and let Claude write it for you. Want an agent that enriches leads and routes them to Salesforce? Just say so. Claude Code generates the agent definition—you review, tweak, and deploy.

**The fastest path from idea to working agent is a conversation.**

### 2. Full Context, Not Just a Prompt

Traditional AI automation gives you a text box. Claude Code agents get **everything**:

- **Your files**: Reference docs, templates, lookup tables—your agent reads them
- **MCP servers**: Connect to Salesforce, HubSpot, Slack, databases, APIs—your agent uses them
- **Your codebase**: Need domain logic? Your agent understands the context it lives in

**An agent that knows your business, not just your prompt.**

### 3. Built for Long-Horizon Tasks

Most AI tools choke after a few steps. Claude Code was built for complex, multi-step work:

- Research a company across 5 sources
- Cross-reference with your CRM data
- Draft personalized outreach
- Log everything to your database
- Notify the right person on Slack

**One trigger. Twenty steps. No hand-holding.**

## Why You Need Async Agents

Great, you've built a powerful agent. But if it only runs when you're at your keyboard, you're leaving value on the table.

**A lead fills out your form at 3am.**
Without async agents: They wait until you wake up and run your CLI.
With DataGen: An agent enriches, scores, and routes them to the right AE before they've closed the tab.

**A prospect replies to your outbound sequence.**
Without async agents: You manually research their company tomorrow morning.
With DataGen: An agent pulls their latest funding news, tech stack, and org chart—ready in your inbox when you wake up.

**A deal moves to "Negotiation" in your CRM.**
Without async agents: You scramble to prep materials.
With DataGen: An agent generates a competitive battlecard and pricing comparison before your next call.

**A user signs up for your free trial.**
Without async agents: They get a generic welcome email.
With DataGen: An agent researches their company, identifies their use case, and drafts a personalized onboarding message.
