Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nMichael Riedler: So many people where.\nMichael Riedler: And, and I really learned about LinkedIn scraping.\nMichael Riedler: Like it's, it's, it's, you know, when you know about it, it's like, it's very basic and easy.\nMichael Riedler: But, and I, I kind of learned what especially for kind of B2B companies or US data providers.\nMichael Riedler: Not just us, but there's the biggest ones.\nMichael Riedler: The data side is a commodity, but the risk side, the trust side is not.\nMichael Riedler: So what they want really is everyone wants the data, but no one wants to break the rules to get the data.\nMichael Riedler: So.\nMichael Riedler: And I think, and I've just noticed there's so much dishonesty in the space, so I just thought I'm gonna jump on it and like be basically just have a good setup where I'm the middleman and I'm gonna, I tell these clients that I'm the middleman and make money, can go scrape it directly.\nMichael Riedler: But for the middleman, setup is I can be a trusted entity to them and they don't have to contract with all these dodgy scrapers out there.\nMichael Riedler: So it's, so I'm kind of, you know, it's a very basic concept, but it's just a win win for everyone.\nMichael Riedler: Like I made money, the data provider, they don't need to contract with all the dodgy guys.\nMichael Riedler: And I just, I built, man, I've built a simple waterfall API, everything, cloud code and, and Gemini.\nMichael Riedler: And it's so simple.\nMichael Riedler: It's just, I connected six scraping tools.\nMichael Riedler: A little bit of a waterfall logic and.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: And then the client.\nyusheng kuo: Who do you think have the best like data nowadays?\nyusheng kuo: I know scrapping is good.\nMichael Riedler: I mean I don't, I don't work with scraping because I know, you know, when I left at least a month ago that they weren't doing any scraping themselves.\nMichael Riedler: So I want to work with people who actually scrape.\nMichael Riedler: Right.\nMichael Riedler: That's, that's like the minimum.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, oh, oh, really?\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: So that's why they are not.\nyusheng kuo: But they do the provisioning stuff, right?\nMichael Riedler: Well, they, I mean a Lot of people do it like them is that they're going to work with third party providers that do the actual scraping and then they put a margin on top.\nyusheng kuo: And it's like RB2B.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: They don't, they don't do any kind of ID denominators themselves.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, exactly.\nMichael Riedler: And this client just saw how it happened is I made a, just networking like I made a friend like a contact in Chicago and he's deep in the B2B data space and he, whenever he has a deal he lives on like commission so he sends me like hey, can you help me with this type of data?\nMichael Riedler: Can you help me with that?\nMichael Riedler: And I had a catch up with him, was telling him what I'm doing and then this company requested that data, LinkedIn data and so he connected and then, and that, that's it, that's how it worked.\nMichael Riedler: So it wasn't.\nyusheng kuo: So you just provide an API and then you, you yourself like go to those like I guess because you know who, who does like a real scrapper are.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: Not just like exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Landing page.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, yeah, exactly.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: I mean, I mean I do.\nMichael Riedler: It's, it's sometimes hard to do.\nMichael Riedler: At least I'm testing them.\nMichael Riedler: I'm, you know, I'm, it's not always clear.\nMichael Riedler: I'm.\nMichael Riedler: But I'm at the moment trying to build the best network in the world in that LinkedIn data space.\nMichael Riedler: So I have now six that I'm contracting with.\nMichael Riedler: But I think I want to find more, you know because the goal is to go high volume.\nMichael Riedler: So the client that's going live now, they do 5 million a month if I get 10 of these million scrapes and that means that I want to do more.\nMichael Riedler: I want to do like 300 million per month because that means you have every single profile fresh in the database as well.\nMichael Riedler: So you have, you make money in the scraping and you have the data so we can launch so many add on products on top of it.\nyusheng kuo: Right, right, right.\nMichael Riedler: But in, and the other customers, they mostly come from scraping I've built.\nMichael Riedler: You know, I'm gonna, I'm moving over some clients from my former, you know.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nMichael Riedler: That, that's of course and, and this, and this type of setup, that's just the waterfall API is a side project.\nMichael Riedler: We're launching another thing that's just another brand for email to LinkedIn and I have also at the moment all I'm doing is selling to data providers and whatever they need.\nMichael Riedler: I'm looking, you know.\nMichael Riedler: Okay, these are all simple features I don't you know, once that Watford API is running that thing doesn't need much maintenance.\nyusheng kuo: You know that just goes no, no, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Just make sure it's like have high availability and that's it.\nyusheng kuo: And it's like super simple logic.\nyusheng kuo: So it's like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, like it's hard to break.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nMichael Riedler: So and the guy I'm working with, my partner now, Alice Ale, he's a engineer, decade long engineer and founder and he reviewed all the code I've you know, created with.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, yeah.\nMichael Riedler: He loved, he said man like this is.\nMichael Riedler: He reviewed it and he's like we don't need to change anything.\nMichael Riedler: It's fine, I will just leave it.\nyusheng kuo: Where do you deploy that?\nyusheng kuo: Like you go to like I put it.\nMichael Riedler: I deployed on Google Google Cloud.\nyusheng kuo: Oh Google.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah yeah yeah that's a good.\nMichael Riedler: But he said maybe we can move it somewhere else or it.\nMichael Riedler: But he said look it doesn't matter like it's going to be functional.\nMichael Riedler: I just wanted to make sure security wise.\nMichael Riedler: I don't know.\nMichael Riedler: You know, in the beginning I was all the API keys and GitHub or whatever.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nMichael Riedler: I did all these beginner mistakes until.\nMichael Riedler: Because if you're not an engineer you don't fully understand how suddenly everything moves to GitHub and you don't really know what happened.\nyusheng kuo: But.\nyusheng kuo: But nowadays actually kind of easy.\nyusheng kuo: I was much easier to pick up because like you know my, my current problem is like okay, search the web or based on your understanding what's the best practice?\nyusheng kuo: Like propose like see few but then they kind of give me good understanding.\nyusheng kuo: What's the trade off?\nyusheng kuo: Understanding.\nyusheng kuo: Yes, that's a very quick way to, to learn that.\nyusheng kuo: But the shortcut is like once you, once they propose you can directly say okay, implement this one for me.\nyusheng kuo: You just like decide, decide which one.\nyusheng kuo: Like like understand the pro and concept and then just decide.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah well so yeah that's kind of how we, you know, how, how I I'm doing it.\nMichael Riedler: I mean I'm very happy with I left scraping end of the year like early January.\nMichael Riedler: What is it now?\nMichael Riedler: Early Feb. You know we started business.\nMichael Riedler: We have a cost ready to sign.\nMichael Riedler: It's just in the legal space.\nMichael Riedler: Product is live.\nMichael Riedler: I'm gonna now this guy I'm working with, he has already a product in the market that does about a few million revenue.\nMichael Riedler: So I'm going to help.\nMichael Riedler: No, it's an email tool.\nMichael Riedler: It's called Any mail.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nMichael Riedler: It's called Any Mail Finder.\nMichael Riedler: So it's in terms of email finding is like one of the, you know, in terms of the quality it's so, so good.\nMichael Riedler: And so I'm helping this grow.\nMichael Riedler: I'll get some shares in that one and then we start a new company that we own, 5050 and we're just gonna put every new project gonna put in there and our vision at the moment is launch different things and see, see what sticks.\nMichael Riedler: But all in that, you know, B2B2B market, B2B data market.\nyusheng kuo: For this one, for this, any mail.\nyusheng kuo: Because based on email people sign up and find the linking or exactly the opposite.\nMichael Riedler: It's the opposite.\nMichael Riedler: It's mainly you provide a name domain or you provide the LinkedIn URL and they have massive infrastructure to get the valid email address.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nMichael Riedler: Okay so that, that's the main, the main feature what people use.\nMichael Riedler: There is some other features but that, that's the main one.\nMichael Riedler: And yeah, I mean it's so basic but it's totally needed constantly.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nMichael Riedler: So it's.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's like a rice, right.\nyusheng kuo: Like a bread.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Like everyone needs to eat.\nyusheng kuo: It doesn't matter if it's a commodity.\nyusheng kuo: You always kind of get like some share.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And then the nice thing is like the floor is kind of set.\nyusheng kuo: No one can get even lower.\nyusheng kuo: So you just like pick whatever you found.\nyusheng kuo: Maybe it's about more like a local promotion.\nyusheng kuo: Local ad.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Finally decide what you want to do.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nMichael Riedler: So I'm just working with him building the watch but at the same time I have plenty of space.\nMichael Riedler: Space to you know, work on new ideas which I love.\nMichael Riedler: You know it's a good setup and there's so many ideas in my head.\nMichael Riedler: But let's.\nMichael Riedler: There's one I need to run by you.\nMichael Riedler: But let's start one by one we're going to look at.\nMichael Riedler: Tell me very.\nMichael Riedler: What have you done since we last spoke with the go to market?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So.\nyusheng kuo: So one thing I, I really like the idea and I think even kind of open club is that's like a time step action.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: So yes, I viewed this.\nyusheng kuo: So let me, let me.\nyusheng kuo: Because I'm on my laptop.\nyusheng kuo: Let me try to pull that.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Just give me one second.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: So.\nyusheng kuo: It.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, let me show you.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: So I'm not working with.\nyusheng kuo: So I don't, you know, Jeremy is kind of helping us to.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's okay.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Not any bad guy but yeah, these are helping us to kind of introduce data gen to, to clients.\nyusheng kuo: He's a go to market consultant.\nyusheng kuo: It's like a rev out Guy.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And.\nyusheng kuo: He had a hard time to like push out MCP product but because recently we start to do this kind of train your car co agent to be life thing.\nyusheng kuo: They are kind of interested and so we try to build out some for the company he owns like he's contracted with and yeah.\nMichael Riedler: So essentially for it's a go to market agency consultant.\nMichael Riedler: And this is for a client of his kind of thing.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's one of his clients.\nyusheng kuo: And you want to see okay.\nyusheng kuo: What this like agent can do with it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, we haven't like go very deep in that but you can see like.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, this is a repository of he.\nMichael Riedler: Set up that I don't see.\nMichael Riedler: I. I see the, the Google Meet window.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, try to do it again.\nMichael Riedler: Okay, now I'm Google Meet.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: And hopefully you can see this.\nMichael Riedler: So I'm.\nMichael Riedler: I'm still on the Google Meet.\nyusheng kuo: Let me turn up, turn off my.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Presentation.\nyusheng kuo: Sorry.\nMichael Riedler: Is it Internet slower?\nMichael Riedler: You are.\nyusheng kuo: Could be maybe you turn off the other camera.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, let me try it again.\nyusheng kuo: Let me rejoin again.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, okay.\nMichael Riedler: Okay, okay.\nMichael Riedler: Okay, Let's try.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, let's try.\nyusheng kuo: Give me one more shot.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, of course.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nMichael Riedler: Okay.\nMichael Riedler: So I can see the meat right.\nMichael Riedler: Window.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Can you see this one now?\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nMichael Riedler: Oh, ghosty.\nMichael Riedler: Now I'm getting in.\nyusheng kuo: I'm.\nMichael Riedler: No, I'm not.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's one of the nicest.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, I've gone down the rabbit hole now.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It has to.\nyusheng kuo: It's like so, so fun.\nyusheng kuo: It's like all of a sudden you have some kind of superpower.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: So.\nyusheng kuo: So, so yeah, here's like let me quickly kind of go through so except yeah, love the, the repository.\nyusheng kuo: One have like cloud IFP of course and some resources like other stuff and some scripts to do some stuff.\nyusheng kuo: And you have this sales and then sales is like a.\nyusheng kuo: It's like a sales reps name and then I think they are.\nMichael Riedler: Sales is a sales rep's name.\nMichael Riedler: The name of people.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So he set up one for each.\nyusheng kuo: The idea is like eventually we will just deploy their own agent for each of them.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And you can I think go to, go to.\nMichael Riedler: So now you, you're going into one agent and looking at target accounts.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: And where is target account in the resources?\nyusheng kuo: No, no, target account is in one of the rep.\nyusheng kuo: So each rep is a kind of ae I think almost.\nMichael Riedler: Yes, got it.\nyusheng kuo: Each one have their target account.\nMichael Riedler: And is this target accounts are they statically defined somewhere in a file or is there some magic going on?\nyusheng kuo: So the target account I think is falling from.\nyusheng kuo: He build a clay table to kind of do the first level, like enrichment and send it to here.\nMichael Riedler: Okay, got it, got it.\nyusheng kuo: Maybe I don't know the detail, but maybe some of it is like their existing customer.\nyusheng kuo: So they pull from the.\nyusheng kuo: The.\nyusheng kuo: I think there are two type of.\nyusheng kuo: Is one of the.\nyusheng kuo: It's a target account.\nyusheng kuo: It's like the account they want to penetrate into, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then this is like also kind of the.\nyusheng kuo: The account they already have.\nyusheng kuo: And then maybe they want to like upsell whatever.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So that's what the target account about.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: And.\nMichael Riedler: So now you're in the target accounts folder.\nMichael Riedler: And now you do.\nyusheng kuo: And then.\nyusheng kuo: And then.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, and then there are two account, right?\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: One is by dance.\nyusheng kuo: We all know what IT finance is like, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know what this one is.\nMichael Riedler: Okay.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So.\nyusheng kuo: So the bigger background.\nyusheng kuo: This is a company.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: That's a legal enforcement.\nyusheng kuo: Like they try to help you to make your legal job easier.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's a company.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And.\nyusheng kuo: And then we just get into.\nyusheng kuo: We just went in one level deeper.\nyusheng kuo: Go to this account.\nMichael Riedler: Right.\nMichael Riedler: Okay, got it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: Oh, nice.\nyusheng kuo: Now you have this kind of a.\nyusheng kuo: This is a.\nyusheng kuo: Basically a play table result.\nyusheng kuo: I can show you.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Let's use cursor to open this one.\nMichael Riedler: I love watching you using the terminal because I need to learn how to use it.\nyusheng kuo: I'm not an expert, but.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, let's try.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so in this account we have this.\nyusheng kuo: Basically it's a JSON file.\nyusheng kuo: It's like you get some like business model summary confidence level of this thing and be updated.\nMichael Riedler: But what I'm interested is that account, Jason, is that based on.\nMichael Riedler: So that's external data.\nMichael Riedler: Right.\nMichael Riedler: Because that's not a customer yet.\nMichael Riedler: It's outbound, Right.\nMichael Riedler: They want to target.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Now it's still outbound.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: So you basically just create a kind of a structured JSON that has like the.\nMichael Riedler: The basic stuff of this account in there.\nyusheng kuo: Exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I think.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But then.\nyusheng kuo: Then now become like into cloud code, right?\nyusheng kuo: So.\nyusheng kuo: Yes, we try to.\nyusheng kuo: So I started to create some other like for competitive move.\nMichael Riedler: I love it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: Like what does less mean?\nMichael Riedler: Is that open a file.\nyusheng kuo: It's like, like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, open the file and then let you like show it.\nyusheng kuo: So you don't need to.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's probably easier to show in cursor.\nyusheng kuo: I can kind of use it more.\nyusheng kuo: Let me try to show in cursor.\nyusheng kuo: This is what Cursor is like, it's kind of slower.\nyusheng kuo: It's bloody slow.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I'm on her laptop.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, this one.\nMichael Riedler: How many Mac Minis?\nMichael Riedler: That's the question.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Here.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, but I, I feel like, yeah, like I really feel like my meaning would be the opportunity for Apple.\nyusheng kuo: So.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's coming in.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay so we are here.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Let me try to make this logic.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, no, no, I can see it all good.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay so for example, yeah you have this account, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay cool.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then, and then you have like company overview.\nyusheng kuo: Let's use this nice preview data.\nyusheng kuo: Oh gosh.\nyusheng kuo: I don't have the right to do that.\nyusheng kuo: But okay, bear with me.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, they have some kind of understanding transition account to be more like a markdown file and then we have this like notes for everything.\nyusheng kuo: So what I think is like this will actually every day get updated.\nyusheng kuo: Like what's their strategic priority?\nyusheng kuo: What's their upcoming event?\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Those are things that would need to be continued to be updated.\nyusheng kuo: For example, here's the upcoming event for then will be the fiscal year, half year result earning.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: And then there's a year end and you can have more things like okay, what the conference they will be joining.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nMichael Riedler: Everything right.\nyusheng kuo: Everything.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So it's like this is live data.\nMichael Riedler: Nothing they're sponsoring like oh, it's a complete trace of their, their, their events.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: That could be massive if this is like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then like they, they were like okay, what's their fiscal year?\nyusheng kuo: 2023 guidance like and we can make this more structured so you come in every day like updated that yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And, and then like what's there because it's a legal enforcement operation.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So you kind of have some of their understanding of what, what they are using the tool, the process gap.\nyusheng kuo: Like what this company might actually are missing this peer comparison.\nyusheng kuo: So these are all like.\nyusheng kuo: I would call it like a semantic level.\nyusheng kuo: It's not quite a graph yet but it's like a semantic level.\nyusheng kuo: Understand summary.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: One thing, yeah like one thing I'm really interested would be like one is like a recent event, right.\nyusheng kuo: Like what will be the coming one and the agent should be able to.\nyusheng kuo: Oh actually there are some interesting one.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Like 12:16 will be a computer share alliance and here's also signal.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah some kind of signal.\nyusheng kuo: This kind of like bad signal yet.\nyusheng kuo: But it's also like everything you can see is a kind of try to timestamp that.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then one very important Thing I haven't really.\nMichael Riedler: The thing is gone.\nMichael Riedler: The share.\nMichael Riedler: Try again.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, okay.\nMichael Riedler: Just.\nMichael Riedler: Just disappear.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's like here.\nMichael Riedler: That's ghosty.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, I'm back, back, back.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So.\nyusheng kuo: So this action md, right?\nyusheng kuo: It's like.\nyusheng kuo: Because I don't.\nyusheng kuo: He doesn't really provide me everything.\nyusheng kuo: But what I want is like you everyone have like an email, have a linking, have a call, have a meeting, have a conference, an event, internal upcoming.\nyusheng kuo: So there will all be like attack as like returnal upcoming or like a meeting or email.\nyusheng kuo: But like every action will be logged here like what you say.\nyusheng kuo: And it should be logged as a timestamp.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: 100.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then it will just be continued to append it, right.\nyusheng kuo: Like by.\nyusheng kuo: By in the end so the model can quickly come in and then do.\nyusheng kuo: They're called like a tail, right?\nyusheng kuo: They tell me like a read from the end.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And this would be like.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know if you're like.\nyusheng kuo: It'll be so powerful because one of the issue I. I keep hearing from those outbound people is like multi channel.\nyusheng kuo: For example, right.\nyusheng kuo: Like they, they make a call, he didn't respond and they have a linking.\nyusheng kuo: Because now every time like for example, hey Rich.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: They do linking automation.\nyusheng kuo: But like you also do instantly automation email.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: One thing that is always hard for them to check is okay if he actually responding to the email.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: And then LinkedIn doesn't see that.\nyusheng kuo: And your LinkedIn haters will continue to like ask again even they have the email.\nyusheng kuo: But with this kind of complete logging, right.\nyusheng kuo: Like every day you let AI decide what's the next step.\nyusheng kuo: You kind of write your sequence like in natural language like how you want to do and then you can see like even like one of the meeting.\nyusheng kuo: You can even reference on the thing that meeting is about.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So this is like you can continue to log every interaction.\nyusheng kuo: You have this with this client in here.\nyusheng kuo: And then like it's always very hard for like a human being coming into here to update.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But like, yeah, like now that if you try to use the right tool, for example LinkedIn if you use Hayrich.\nyusheng kuo: So every incoming email will trigger that webhook.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Actually can then trigger the like an agent call and then the agent will come in to update this same as email, like instantly have email and then like even we even want to like have the email like inbox.\nyusheng kuo: So any kind of like a meeting also like for example like I just finished the meeting with another guy and then he like the web could also come into like log this meeting what's important.\nyusheng kuo: Like and then everything will have a reference link to let Adrian link to the original.\nyusheng kuo: Just like another level down to the raw data.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: If he needs to go deeper.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So he can quickly review all the action he had done that people have done.\nyusheng kuo: So you no longer have this kind of multi channel.\nyusheng kuo: So you use your LinkedIn or email only as an action and trigger.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: You use this to send email, you use this to send LinkedIn.\nyusheng kuo: You use this to log back the, the linking result.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Like your agent decide who to call next exact contact, what kind of.\nyusheng kuo: And you can have a.\nMichael Riedler: It's a completely different way of thinking.\nMichael Riedler: Right.\nMichael Riedler: Like it's a.\nyusheng kuo: Exactly.\nMichael Riedler: This is, I love this stuff.\nMichael Riedler: You know, I think.\nMichael Riedler: When do you think this is to.\nMichael Riedler: So this is an action log on an account level.\nMichael Riedler: Right.\nMichael Riedler: So it's like super nice like and easy.\nMichael Riedler: When do you think this is too full?\nMichael Riedler: Let's say there was like 50 logs.\nMichael Riedler: Is that too much or when.\nyusheng kuo: No, no, no.\nyusheng kuo: So now we are like so, so I, I, I kind of learned a lot like both by B. Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: B A D. You know, like open cl.\nyusheng kuo: So one thing is like you have this kind of log, you try to log as much as possible and now that actually the, the database get tense because you, you lock that not the source.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So that give you actually the real link to the real data and then your data can be in USS provider, whatever.\nyusheng kuo: It doesn't need to be local.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So first you can kind of.\nyusheng kuo: They call compact.\nyusheng kuo: So they can compact it to a small log while have the way to go to the real full content.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: The second thing is like after you keep locking that, you can compact that too.\nyusheng kuo: You can basically compact all activity into a summary of a January activity.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: So you can keep the fixed constant for the recent one.\nyusheng kuo: You keep adding that every detail.\nyusheng kuo: But the old one, you summarize that into just one single line.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And if you, if you want like Google, you have an infinity amount because they got storage nowadays like so cheap.\nyusheng kuo: It's the ingress and the egress is expensive like putting in and putting out.\nyusheng kuo: So storing is not expensive.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So now it's a markdown.\nyusheng kuo: But I think we would be able to save it to any kind of a login like database.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then model can just read it.\nyusheng kuo: But the idea is like if we can like just like you say we first have an agent to basically each of this is an agent.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Try to monitor what's incoming and then once they come in with a web call they will log things here.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then we will just another like daily.\nyusheng kuo: For example, a daily agent would go in and summarize whatever action have done and then reference on some of the cloud MD like how we should summarize things like the semantic view of it.\nyusheng kuo: Turn it into like overview.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, like a.\nyusheng kuo: Based on like a recent event MD which is every day we'll try to look up some kind of news or like company website.\nyusheng kuo: You can kind of define the source and it would just like continue log and then he will look at your action.\nyusheng kuo: You look at your competitor.\nyusheng kuo: Is it another listening.\nyusheng kuo: It's just like basically you can think of this a lot of listener.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: To log everything and then you have another agent come in to summarize them.\nyusheng kuo: So you are a company over U is like very high level but very like reflect the recent activity instead of like a stale.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So that's like I took a lot of inspiration because you told me about this kind of like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah like a login.\nyusheng kuo: I think it's like really popular because like even open club this is how they do things.\nyusheng kuo: Like you just continue to log your markdown of your action trace and then later on actually save it to a database or like cemented pool of the data.\nyusheng kuo: And we can like for this particular.\nyusheng kuo: Hey, you can have an agent to come in to like just constantly summarize the thing and update that thing.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: So you.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's like that's.\nyusheng kuo: That's where I am.\nMichael Riedler: And what's that?\nMichael Riedler: What's the codex fit?\nMichael Riedler: Oh, that's them.\nMichael Riedler: That's them.\nMichael Riedler: It's like how is it.\nMichael Riedler: How good is of an account is that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Like the healthiness like how like for example if they already work with a competitor right.\nyusheng kuo: Then yes product speed would be low because like they already have a.\nyusheng kuo: It's hard for them to move where if they have a new coming like a CIO or C coo like a legal like General Counselor.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: If they're coming there's a new one coming in.\nyusheng kuo: Then there's a.\nyusheng kuo: The fifth one.\nyusheng kuo: So again it's like idea is like alien will coming in every day to like like update the thing making things the precious as possible possible.\nyusheng kuo: And it's a different.\nyusheng kuo: It's a different like a table base.\nyusheng kuo: And.\nyusheng kuo: And then the cool thing is like you can have different because of the data here, right?\nyusheng kuo: You can have a different folder structure unlike like whether it's clay or like a traditional CRM, everything is like a table one, one table fit for all your, your, your, your, your account.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: But here you can like oh, but this account, I think I need more of this type of thing.\nyusheng kuo: But for this account I look slightly different.\nyusheng kuo: You don't need to have that kind of a one table fit.\nyusheng kuo: All like data structure.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So it's like.\nMichael Riedler: And what's, what's.\nMichael Riedler: So with this in place, what do you want to test of this client?\nMichael Riedler: Like what kind of do you now want to basically run, you know, Claude code and create that campaign?\nMichael Riedler: Or what's the.\nMichael Riedler: How do you want this to be used?\nMichael Riedler: Or how do you envision to use this?\nyusheng kuo: They already have like a B1 what they want to do.\nyusheng kuo: So the B1 is actually quite simple because we still need to fine tune all this stuff.\nyusheng kuo: Like basically try to test out the agent how well they can continue to log out this stuff.\nyusheng kuo: And also we need the access to their web everything.\nyusheng kuo: So the first step is actually they were just like sending out this account JSON.\nyusheng kuo: So whenever there's a new account coming in for this like this wrap, it will send out this account JSON and also the contact file.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So and then we will summarize this and tell him like okay, based on other accounts, what's your activity?\nyusheng kuo: What's your next best next move.\nyusheng kuo: And then because we recently have this feature called.\nyusheng kuo: We launched this feature for example like this daily activity Recorder.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nMichael Riedler: Is that.\nMichael Riedler: It's kind of based on the heartbeat logic from Claude.\nyusheng kuo: God yeah.\nyusheng kuo: This is a conjure.\nyusheng kuo: So every day at 8am he will send out this report to me.\nyusheng kuo: You will read my repository and say okay here's a report generated, it will be sent to me and here's my user activity, the top performer Critical alert, something like that.\nyusheng kuo: The thing is, it's not just that report.\nyusheng kuo: These are agents I can talk to.\nyusheng kuo: So I say okay, have we any more new table in Neom to check users?\nyusheng kuo: Because my co founder actually just had a few things I want to check.\nyusheng kuo: Do we have a new thing?\nyusheng kuo: And he said based on the my analysis the code base no new table has been added.\nyusheng kuo: So this yesterday I also have a use case is like my meeting summarizer.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So after I finish an internal meeting he said okay, we need to have a UI UX review of data gen and I have a 14 to do item that we need to do.\nyusheng kuo: We just identify like UI issue.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, can you tell me which information should we price for day?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so like and then it will respond oh like top five products that you should do.\nyusheng kuo: So like, so the idea is like rep can kind of come in and see the report and ask the follow up question like why this account is good?\nyusheng kuo: What kind of supporting app than this?\nyusheng kuo: And then like can you give me more level detail things?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, and then we like go.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, no, no, no, you go oh.\nyusheng kuo: The thing I really like email is it can have very clear threat of your activity.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, like, like and then for different client.\nyusheng kuo: And then it's like everyone have email, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's like the third thing is like yeah, it can present really large like beautiful data collected in email.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then you can like for example we have this.\nyusheng kuo: I actually have this product, This one.\nyusheng kuo: One second.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I probably deleted it.\nyusheng kuo: I watch it and I deleted it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah but it's like a.\nyusheng kuo: Like here I actually asked my agent to pay like a really well formatted one.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And now if I see anyone I can just like email and then I can just like start to contact it.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Question about he even come prepare the title for me.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's like already have a have a small app within and I yeah if he.\nyusheng kuo: I see any issue I get like just the other day because we have an issue of Google right.\nyusheng kuo: And I saw this guy is using it, I immediately just.\nyusheng kuo: I call here and say hey we have an issue here.\nyusheng kuo: If you have anything I don't need to like go in just very important.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: Explain to me this guy who did 2000 runs.\nMichael Riedler: What is a run?\nyusheng kuo: Oh, the run is just Wait, wait.\nMichael Riedler: You know when you have you.\nMichael Riedler: You look at a user list and you have high intent, no active users.\nMichael Riedler: So this person, this 1994 runs.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, so what, what does that mean?\nyusheng kuo: So it means he run the custom pool 2000 type but he's like continue to test it.\nyusheng kuo: He's a guy who.\nyusheng kuo: That I told you that trying to help us to break it.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, there's a kind of untapped for him.\nyusheng kuo: It's kind of untapped for him.\nMichael Riedler: And where is he using this in cloud code?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Oh cloud AI.\nMichael Riedler: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Because it's just a MCP tool route, right?\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So the way you set up.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, let me actually show you.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So now all this agent right.\nyusheng kuo: I just created.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So the tools the run is.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: You can ignore there's like a terminology like internally we didn't even well name it.\nyusheng kuo: So it's like only us like understand what it means.\nyusheng kuo: But yeah, Run is like a tool run.\nyusheng kuo: Like for example, I run this one.\nyusheng kuo: I run some custom tool.\nMichael Riedler: I got it.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Because I can create any tool can be considered as an API.\nyusheng kuo: You can create get weather for example, you become an API and you have a code like say okay, I need to go to this open weather.\nyusheng kuo: Get my weather.\nyusheng kuo: This is like you can directly deploy the API from our mcp.\nyusheng kuo: Yes, basically.\nyusheng kuo: And then also this is just.\nyusheng kuo: I can install whatever MCP I want here.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And they'll also become a tool.\nyusheng kuo: That's the tool.\nyusheng kuo: Wrong.\nyusheng kuo: And then for the agent is like if you create an agent cloud, then it will become the agent MD file.\nyusheng kuo: So for example, we have this daily activity recorder.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So if I have a webhook.\nyusheng kuo: So every day for this one actually I create a schedule.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Daily crown job like am every day.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So like.\nyusheng kuo: So this would actually come back to the original one.\nyusheng kuo: Like I can both give this agents welcome to my.\nyusheng kuo: For example the.\nyusheng kuo: The meeting summary one.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So I have a ton of age about it.\nMichael Riedler: No, that's good.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: I'm not surprised.\nyusheng kuo: Well yeah, but I would say like to make the agent you still need to put in after to make it really align.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Otherwise it's just bunch of noise.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So I have this agent.\nyusheng kuo: I would actually I just give it to the.\nyusheng kuo: If you look at my firefly.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Something quick.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah man.\nMichael Riedler: It's crazy.\nMichael Riedler: Once you're used to like this new world.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's like wait, why it's so slow.\nyusheng kuo: But I still need to come in to set up my web hook.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So there's go to here.\nyusheng kuo: So you can give it my book.\nyusheng kuo: So every time the meeting finish.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It would just send to here and then you can see the.\nyusheng kuo: The agent log.\nyusheng kuo: He just actually come in and here's the payload.\nyusheng kuo: Actually he sent it to just finish.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: And my agent would just go ahead to like pull the.\nyusheng kuo: For the.\nyusheng kuo: For the tour result.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then.\nyusheng kuo: And then eventually I gotta save it, write it basically just a cloud code in the cloud and then coming with this.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then.\nyusheng kuo: And it will update my repository directly like here.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's the idea.\nyusheng kuo: Like.\nyusheng kuo: So if you have a lot of agent like working on the same repository.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Repository would just be alive.\nyusheng kuo: Like you don't need to take care that like I have a news agent that will come into for this repository.\nyusheng kuo: So each repository have its own agent fleet to update it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: This is how we kind of keep our context Updated like autonomously.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Like every day we try to search the most relevant Coco related linking post and give it to us so we know who should we contact.\nyusheng kuo: You.\nyusheng kuo: And then I can like one thing I really want to do is like after I get this email, right.\nyusheng kuo: For example I. I get.\nyusheng kuo: Earlier I have this email about the.\nyusheng kuo: Wait, what is it?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, like for example I get this meeting summarizer.\nyusheng kuo: What do you want to do?\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And I can just like forward to another agent, another agent and say like hey, like look at this, like what we want to do.\nyusheng kuo: Do it for me.\nyusheng kuo: And then like angel would just do it another one, you know.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's what we are trying to do next.\nMichael Riedler: You can trigger these agents from anywhere.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, yeah.\nMichael Riedler: YouTube, email, API.\nMichael Riedler: So wherever, whenever you want to intervene, you can let them, you know.\nMichael Riedler: And maybe some are live, right?\nMichael Riedler: Maybe if the ones that have a heartbeat, they can, you know, whatever.\nMichael Riedler: They'll, they'll.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nMichael Riedler: We have.\nMichael Riedler: Let's say I'm from this lead and you have a meeting with me and I'll mention something like hey, you know, we're going to acquire a new business or we are unhappy with our legal software.\nMichael Riedler: I mean that's like, whoa, you.\nMichael Riedler: That's like that changes the game, right?\nMichael Riedler: For this Target account I'm mentioning something interesting and then it's like you know, one thing in, in outbound, I think, you know, I mean if you, you work with someone, they, you know, just make it work for their use case.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: For me it's really, it's very transactional.\nMichael Riedler: So the way people do it without agents is really, they blast out a lot of emails, LinkedIn, know, whatever and all they care, they don't give a.\nMichael Riedler: Right.\nMichael Riedler: They want a meeting and they want to sell right now.\nMichael Riedler: But the biggest opportunities, like for instance you asked me earlier how did I get this other client?\nMichael Riedler: It comes from with someone who I had a meeting with but that didn't turn into a sale.\nMichael Riedler: But then you know, 12 months later it does with someone.\nMichael Riedler: You know the kind of.\nMichael Riedler: All these meetings we do with potential with just interesting people in our network.\nMichael Riedler: Everyone is a prospect but also kind of a partner.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, exactly.\nMichael Riedler: You build up like some.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, like you said, this thing's alive, you know.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's like every day we're looking into it and say like.\nyusheng kuo: Because I, I remember I have a friend telling like one of the atl is like he emailed someone like from 11love but he forgot to like follow up.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Because like he doesn't log there he's forgot.\nyusheng kuo: And then he feels so regretful.\nyusheng kuo: So he just really wants someone that can get reminded.\nyusheng kuo: So if we have like a RP agent like every.\nyusheng kuo: It depends.\nyusheng kuo: Like again if you said hobby's super short actually the token will be super expensive.\nyusheng kuo: That's what the real life experience for open cloth.\nyusheng kuo: Make sure your hobby is not too short.\nyusheng kuo: But like I said, okay.\nyusheng kuo: Even like a half day.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: So he was just coming in and check all the.\nyusheng kuo: The very least like recent activity and then he can have.\nyusheng kuo: Have a.\nyusheng kuo: Like a to do here right?\nyusheng kuo: Like oh, every day he.\nyusheng kuo: He summarizes that you should remember by someday sometime try to contact someone and then.\nyusheng kuo: And then you.\nyusheng kuo: You will see that one.\nyusheng kuo: And then it's like every day you.\nyusheng kuo: You don't.\nyusheng kuo: You don't.\nyusheng kuo: You no longer need to miss.\nyusheng kuo: And then you no longer need to update.\nyusheng kuo: It's like everything just updated for you.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's like.\nyusheng kuo: That's kind of the.\nyusheng kuo: I hope not just for.\nyusheng kuo: Actually to me it's bigger than CRM.\nyusheng kuo: It's like for me as a.\nyusheng kuo: For example, like.\nyusheng kuo: Like my previous example, right.\nyusheng kuo: Like without.\nyusheng kuo: Without this.\nyusheng kuo: I don't remember it.\nyusheng kuo: I don't check the daily user activity.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know how they are doing.\nyusheng kuo: But now I can like even I'm not a sales people, right.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Well, I get.\nyusheng kuo: I guess I part of me.\nyusheng kuo: I still be eased but like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I just need to have a way for people to continue to.\nyusheng kuo: To.\nyusheng kuo: To proactively remind me of things and tell me things and I can like one.\nyusheng kuo: One message away to finish the thing.\nyusheng kuo: I see this.\nMichael Riedler: You essentially you looked at Clockbot, right?\nMichael Riedler: How it's built.\nMichael Riedler: I did too but.\nMichael Riedler: But it's amazing.\nMichael Riedler: It's really like it.\nMichael Riedler: It opened up a new thinking, right?\nMichael Riedler: Like a new framework.\nMichael Riedler: And now you think you're applying it on Outbound essentially like some version of this.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: It's like I try to make it more confined and the nice thing about this is just it could scale like because each of them is like I use the repository.\nyusheng kuo: It has a limitation, right.\nyusheng kuo: Like it doesn't really have a browser everything at the moment.\nyusheng kuo: But by using this repository I can kind of almost create a small mini.\nyusheng kuo: Right for each of that with a very specific task around those agents.\nyusheng kuo: So they have a confined context.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Context within them.\nyusheng kuo: And then it's good or bad.\nyusheng kuo: Well, sometimes you want to enter into a repository, but most of the time I want to have like compliance go.\nyusheng kuo: And then this would just really help Me to create that and then because each of them is like new instance being created.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So I can scale that.\nyusheng kuo: I can have like a 2000 like agents spin out without memory, like memory crash.\nMichael Riedler: So the way you're doing is essentially man, I definitely going to try it.\nMichael Riedler: So essentially when I sign up, you're going to create a repository and I can.\nyusheng kuo: So you add the repository locally.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So the way you do is like you give me your GitHub access.\nyusheng kuo: They basically install your GitHub app to your repository on GitHub and it will pull the GitHub repository and then parse it and then you will populate, for example.\nyusheng kuo: Interesting.\nyusheng kuo: Live here.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, cool.\nyusheng kuo: Not too many.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: I think I have an agent.\nMichael Riedler: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: For example here we save it.\nyusheng kuo: I just add another repository and now I can add this one right Now I can say connect.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then now I have.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, maybe there's a bot.\nyusheng kuo: How kind it doesn't connect.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: I think it's a bot.\nMichael Riedler: Tell the agent.\nMichael Riedler: Hey agent, if you're listening.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Like if I thought you would still not.\nyusheng kuo: Oh no, no, no, no.\nyusheng kuo: That's not because the reason.\nyusheng kuo: Because I don't have an agent Building employees.\nMichael Riedler: Oh, I see.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: He doesn't have the.\nyusheng kuo: He only has skill.\nyusheng kuo: He doesn't have agent.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, but that means with this setup I can then use it locally, right?\nMichael Riedler: I can then have that files, you know, downloaded on my local machine.\nyusheng kuo: You will basically it's.\nyusheng kuo: This is kind of sync like a.\nyusheng kuo: Think of that as like Dropbox.\nyusheng kuo: You can kind of work locally.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So once they finish it would clone or like a sync in the cloud and then it will be.\nyusheng kuo: It will be pulled to local.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So it's like the nice thing is now this thing can be accessed to all your external service because everything is like living in your local.\nyusheng kuo: They could like really access to your external service.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: So this is like the way.\nMichael Riedler: How does.\nMichael Riedler: So in a way, if I.\nMichael Riedler: If Claude code is doing something, let's say an agent vault will help me to, you know, tell me who should I reach out to.\nMichael Riedler: Or we'll actually send an email.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: And that gets logged in the actions file.\nMichael Riedler: For instance, does that need to be pushed to GitHub for you to know about this?\nMichael Riedler: You know, or how does that get synced?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so it will be pushed to the GitHub.\nyusheng kuo: So like for example, this like daily activity report, right?\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, nice.\nyusheng kuo: It doesn't render perfect.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, now there you go.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So you will Actually.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, actually I should go to Agent Doc.\nyusheng kuo: So like for example this meeting summarize after it's finished, right?\nMichael Riedler: You can see a pull request.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: What has been changed?\nMichael Riedler: You're using GitHub as like the node.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: That's cool man.\nMichael Riedler: I love that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, because you can kind of naturally.\nyusheng kuo: Like we have an option for you to like for example like to.\nyusheng kuo: To.\nyusheng kuo: To auto merge.\nyusheng kuo: So the three modes.\nyusheng kuo: One is the create PR auto merge or scheme is like you never write anything because some people like using their GitHub repo as like ground facts, not as like artifact.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: It's like just a principle of doing things for like a left second for people.\nyusheng kuo: And auto merge is like whenever you do something you just emerge it.\nyusheng kuo: But I like create PR so I can kind of review.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: And then I would say okay, this is good.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, of course I don't read transcript but I read like a summary.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then, and then I would say okay then based on the summary.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, this like media summary is good.\nyusheng kuo: Then I would just like merge it and that give me like a good like control.\nyusheng kuo: Like.\nMichael Riedler: Where do you, where do you see it?\nMichael Riedler: You know how does that.\nMichael Riedler: This, how does this impact like data gen right now?\nMichael Riedler: Like where do you with all of this?\nMichael Riedler: Where do you see yourself at the moment?\nMichael Riedler: Do you want to build almost like a clay thing?\nyusheng kuo: No, no, I don't think it's a clay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I feel it's more of a before clay thing.\nyusheng kuo: Like you can use clay as a tool, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's like it's more than clay.\nyusheng kuo: Like your every contacts and.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I mean if you want to run parallel, right.\nyusheng kuo: You want to run like 2,000, you know, I mean like you want to do like a 2000 very mechanical enrichment play or NASD or good tool.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: You don't need the agent to do it.\nyusheng kuo: You just like call a web hook and wait for like a.\nyusheng kuo: So basically after the finish the clay will send a webhook to say oh I finished.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, we'll just look at the data and see what do we need to do.\nyusheng kuo: Like the example here is like clay will push into our repository too.\nyusheng kuo: So we have this kind of account.\nyusheng kuo: JSON.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: Nice.\nMichael Riedler: You use clay as a database.\nyusheng kuo: That's part of it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Because we.\nyusheng kuo: I don't just use one data source.\nyusheng kuo: I have neon.\nyusheng kuo: I play.\nyusheng kuo: But you're right like clay is like I think clay both a data source and also like a, like a runner.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Because you can run like a 50 something row in parallel.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: That's a very good like Nan could be my runner.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Like.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's like every, every SaaS tool could be part of my tour through the MCP server.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So the agent actually any MCP tool here are available to the agent here.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Like that's how I pull the meeting.\nMichael Riedler: Right.\nyusheng kuo: I actually use the fireflies MCP tool to pull the meeting data.\nyusheng kuo: So like a Notion is my database.\nyusheng kuo: Firecrow is like training the web into my database.\nyusheng kuo: I just have a lot of tools.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So I can, I can push the thing back to for example like audio.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: I can push the.\nyusheng kuo: So so that some rap doesn't like to be the GitHub.\nyusheng kuo: So it's.\nyusheng kuo: I can both like all the thing as like this kind of central but also like push it back to all the necessary age.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: App that I'm using like Gmail.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: I use Gmail to read things.\nyusheng kuo: I wanted to push back to Gmail.\nyusheng kuo: I may use Notion for some like a teaching material.\nyusheng kuo: So I push it back to Eddie.\nyusheng kuo: It may be the website is my final edge activity.\nyusheng kuo: So like change lock for example.\nyusheng kuo: So my documentation will auto update it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nMichael Riedler: So it's just like man, it's wild.\nyusheng kuo: The idea is like yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Try to create because we try to make the easy to add to all.\nyusheng kuo: We try to make easy to deploy the agent.\nyusheng kuo: We try to.\nyusheng kuo: Now our new kind of comes as like the infrastructure for cloudcode.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So that's like our new will be our new landing page.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Cloud code is your.\nyusheng kuo: Your CPU and then we try to be make everything around your cloud operation easy.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: So would you be able to run this directly from the command line interface?\nMichael Riedler: You know, could you say.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, connect.\nMichael Riedler: So you do some sort of setup here?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nMichael Riedler: Could I, could I have a.\nMichael Riedler: You know.\nMichael Riedler: You know because I, I mean this is all so amazing.\nMichael Riedler: Like I'm glad you're experimenting this, this in the end, you know that.\nMichael Riedler: No we're all trying to figure it out.\nMichael Riedler: Right.\nMichael Riedler: How to.\nMichael Riedler: So I'm thinking could I run it in the command line and then have kind of deploy agents as we go?\nMichael Riedler: You know like every time I do something or the agent does something and we're like oh for this account I want an agent or for this repo I want.\nMichael Riedler: You know.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: We already have a CLI.\nyusheng kuo: So we have a CLI.\nyusheng kuo: We have McD.\nyusheng kuo: So you can, you can access all the tools through our mcp.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So the tool you added here that can also be used in your Cloud code, like whatever tool available here.\nyusheng kuo: That's our old product.\nyusheng kuo: You kind of already know it.\nyusheng kuo: Now we are missing is directly deploy the agent.\nyusheng kuo: But our friend, one of our co founder already.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I think we also have it here.\nyusheng kuo: So like data gen.\nyusheng kuo: So you can like log in MCP to set up your mcp, start to start the project and then do deploy.\nyusheng kuo: So this is the old thing.\nyusheng kuo: We originally want to use it railway but eventually, eventually we kind of like do the railway originally.\nyusheng kuo: I want to help people to build agent easily and deploy to railway easily.\nyusheng kuo: But we found that it's easier for us to do it every day.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So actually this would just deploy to us.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then you can add the new service.\nyusheng kuo: You can add mcp.\nyusheng kuo: My idea is that you can even call MCP from command line, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, but it's not.\nyusheng kuo: This is not finished yet.\nyusheng kuo: This is what we are working on.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But eventually you will be able to see the agent log, see the deploy the agent.\nMichael Riedler: Exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Everything just do the coi.\nyusheng kuo: So like our idea is like parity, right.\nyusheng kuo: So whatever you can do agent can do.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: In a way you just have a way of, you know, you.\nMichael Riedler: You provide a. I don't know what it is like, you know, we don't know what these things are like product framework, you know, whatever it is like data gen cli.\nMichael Riedler: And then that with this you can run your outbound.\nMichael Riedler: Right.\nMichael Riedler: You have.\nMichael Riedler: And then you might be able to connect it to, you know, all the outbound agents you have here essentially.\nMichael Riedler: Right.\nMichael Riedler: And then you eventually can improve it and other people will figure out some.\nMichael Riedler: Or your agents will figure out ways of doing things right.\nMichael Riedler: Or what.\nMichael Riedler: Or.\nMichael Riedler: Or we'll just learn.\nMichael Riedler: Right.\nMichael Riedler: Like Clockbot.\nMichael Riedler: It will get better at what you know, if.\nMichael Riedler: If the agent knows what emails get response and what emails don't.\nMichael Riedler: They can change.\nMichael Riedler: Right?\nMichael Riedler: They can change.\nMichael Riedler: And in a way this.\nMichael Riedler: This thing can run the whole time.\nMichael Riedler: And is your client, is he already sending outbound without human review or is this still on the human.\nyusheng kuo: No, no, no, no.\nyusheng kuo: This is still.\nyusheng kuo: So this is still providing for this one.\nyusheng kuo: It's still providing the context to the.\nyusheng kuo: To the.\nyusheng kuo: To email.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: To the age sales rep.\nyusheng kuo: I do have a client.\nyusheng kuo: The user.\nyusheng kuo: That client.\nyusheng kuo: That one with the user.\nyusheng kuo: It's like using this Hayrich required gesture.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Every time the hay rich coming in you can read the prompt.\nyusheng kuo: So it will actually fetch the lead.\nyusheng kuo: So whenever the heritage have a coming in.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And we'll find a conversation and then the full history of the conversation.\nyusheng kuo: Do this work.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And analyze and then save to draft.\nyusheng kuo: But he said like if every.\nyusheng kuo: Because he will then send it to the discord for slack.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Like let his client review.\nyusheng kuo: So it's a, it's an outbound agency.\nyusheng kuo: And he said like once the.\nyusheng kuo: They kind of align on the final job for the first few.\nyusheng kuo: He want to just directly go to like perish, like send.\nyusheng kuo: Send message, for example.\nMichael Riedler: Exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: I mean, what I think the real opportunity here is for what you're building is really in the end to skip the agency.\nMichael Riedler: Any company will activate this and they will have, you know, there's so many company who don't have outbound at all to have this active and then almost go from, you know, who knows in the future how.\nMichael Riedler: You know, I mean, how procurement or purchasing is going to happen, but it's going to be there's a human needed, then maybe the agent will talk to another agent and they'll set up a meeting.\nMichael Riedler: You know, I think what I 100 believe is, yeah, we have outbound and we pretend it's N. Or it's Michael.\nMichael Riedler: That's stupid.\nMichael Riedler: I would, the first, the first thing I would be doing is I won't.\nMichael Riedler: I don't pretend I'm a human.\nMichael Riedler: I'm.\nMichael Riedler: I'm an agent.\nMichael Riedler: You know, I'm like, hey, I'm.\nMichael Riedler: I'm.\nMichael Riedler: I'm Data Chen agent and I'm, you know, I did.\nyusheng kuo: You know, I'm here to help you.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, exactly.\nMichael Riedler: So I think the cool thing is to.\nMichael Riedler: You could label this as think of Clockbot, right?\nMichael Riedler: Clockbot is not a human.\nMichael Riedler: You can have something like, you know, you know, I don't know, like, you know, outbound bot or something like that.\nMichael Riedler: And everyone knows it's someone's outbound bot.\nMichael Riedler: But if it's helpful, it's helpful.\nMichael Riedler: You know what I mean?\nMichael Riedler: That doesn't matter.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, and, and, yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I don't care.\nyusheng kuo: Like, and the board will.\nMichael Riedler: Orchestra has a safe environment with all of this intel and will.\nMichael Riedler: And, and the human can steer it.\nMichael Riedler: It can get involved if the, the rep want to.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, yeah.\nMichael Riedler: I mean, I think it's just, it's.\nyusheng kuo: Just like here, right?\nyusheng kuo: Like, you can send me something that gets important because you notice it.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, sorry.\nyusheng kuo: It's just like our email notification, right?\nyusheng kuo: Like, you can send me something saying like, hey, I think this will be useful for you.\nyusheng kuo: That's what we prepare for you.\nyusheng kuo: And I can email back, say, okay, yeah, what's this?\nyusheng kuo: And then your agent will actually Email back to me.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Just like what we show, right.\nyusheng kuo: Actually, the agent will go.\nyusheng kuo: One idea we had is, like, for each prospect we have, actually create a repo for you so it becomes like a.\nyusheng kuo: Like a knowledge for this report, like this prospect.\nyusheng kuo: And then.\nyusheng kuo: Yes, the prospect can continue to ask questions about you.\nyusheng kuo: Your.\nyusheng kuo: Your offering.\nMichael Riedler: Yes, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: And, yeah, and then.\nyusheng kuo: And then, like, eventually they can book a meeting somehow, just all through email.\nyusheng kuo: And I agree with you.\nyusheng kuo: Like, usually you should just be upfront, like, say, hey, I'm.\nyusheng kuo: I'm a agent, not a human being.\nyusheng kuo: But.\nyusheng kuo: But I. I don't.\nyusheng kuo: I don't have emotion.\nyusheng kuo: You can just, like, insult me, whatever you want.\nyusheng kuo: I won't be that.\nMichael Riedler: No, this is so good, man.\nyusheng kuo: I love.\nMichael Riedler: And I think there's.\nMichael Riedler: I mean, I think there is a. Yeah, there's so much possible here.\nMichael Riedler: I mean, you can.\nMichael Riedler: Right.\nMichael Riedler: This is outbound, right?\nMichael Riedler: After outbound, there comes, like, existing customers, like CRM.\nMichael Riedler: I mean, outbound stops once a lead is generated.\nMichael Riedler: Right.\nMichael Riedler: So let's say once you have a target account and there's a meeting with a target account and they indicate interest or.\nMichael Riedler: Or not even that, just a meeting, that's when all the action goes into the CRM.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, exactly.\nMichael Riedler: And then they take over.\nMichael Riedler: But I think you have the opportunity, you know, you maybe expand into that space.\nMichael Riedler: So eventually you might not need a CRM anymore.\nMichael Riedler: Or you can go, you know, just leverage the CRM.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, exactly, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Because most CRM also have the, like.\nyusheng kuo: Like, basically I could.\nyusheng kuo: I can pull in the data and update the CRM.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So, yes, like a software application.\nyusheng kuo: You'll see the CRM.\nyusheng kuo: And when I make a meeting, when they get change, make any change of their CRM, the CRM will trigger the web to call the agent, say, hey, I made a change here.\nyusheng kuo: Update your action md.\nyusheng kuo: So, yeah, I get everything just like always.\nMichael Riedler: Fresh, amazing.\nMichael Riedler: Amazing.\nMichael Riedler: Well, look, I'm gonna test this.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I'm not.\nyusheng kuo: I'm not.\nyusheng kuo: I'm not, like, talking into it.\nyusheng kuo: I'm just.\nMichael Riedler: No, no, I know you're sharing.\nMichael Riedler: No, no, I know.\nMichael Riedler: But I'm actually.\nMichael Riedler: I was curious, you know, when I messaged you, because I'm doing no more coding myself and I want to test it, but also I'm doing outbound for any mail.\nMichael Riedler: And I'm not going to get the agency.\nMichael Riedler: I'm not going to get anyone.\nMichael Riedler: I'm just going to get the agents, do it, everything.\nMichael Riedler: And I'm as, you know, me.\nMichael Riedler: And you know, I don't Want to use a CRM?\nMichael Riedler: I'm just going to use whatever, you know.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So that's.\nyusheng kuo: Use it Neon.\nyusheng kuo: I like neon.\nMichael Riedler: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then, and then they have.\nyusheng kuo: Or superbase.\nyusheng kuo: Oh yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Now I, I don't.\nyusheng kuo: I. I didn't show you here.\nyusheng kuo: But I don't use CRM either.\nyusheng kuo: I use just the database.\nyusheng kuo: And then I, I wrote a script to update everything.\nyusheng kuo: The agent will call the script to update by all the hair, which like all the linking coming in and I was just like reference.\nyusheng kuo: Every morning I do the reference.\nyusheng kuo: Who should I contact today?\nMichael Riedler: I love it.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: So I'm gonna just play with it and we can both experiment with together.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: 100.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Thank you.\nMichael Riedler: And that's.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: And I love how you're thinking about it.\nMichael Riedler: I think in the end, even when we spoke last now like the world's moving.\nMichael Riedler: Exactly.\nMichael Riedler: You know, everything gets simpler right now in my eyes and it's just absolutely mind blowing what's going on.\nMichael Riedler: And you know, it will impact like every part of, you know, the.\nMichael Riedler: On the sales side go to market.\nMichael Riedler: I think the next, the next thing I'm just thinking of a small side project is to.\nMichael Riedler: In my eyes plays a data provider and it's like a bot management tool.\nMichael Riedler: So the value of Clay is to have deals with all the data providers like phone number, email, you know, find company and so on.\nMichael Riedler: I think I want to maybe build a.\nMichael Riedler: You know, because I have access to this data myself because of the work I'm doing.\nMichael Riedler: So I have, you know, a copy of everyone's LinkedIn profile.\nMichael Riedler: I'm getting a monthly update and stuff like that.\nMichael Riedler: So I think it'd be amazing if I just build play in its minimal form, which is just a database, and then make it available in the CLI for humans and agents.\nyusheng kuo: And so this will be.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So we like so like agent friendly.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: This is called like agent like growth.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And then it's like.\nMichael Riedler: And then.\nMichael Riedler: And then agents, what you just shown me.\nMichael Riedler: Imagine if that person had like a full access in the CLI to the data to constantly find account.\nMichael Riedler: You know, that is not publicly on the Internet.\nMichael Riedler: Right.\nMichael Riedler: So.\nMichael Riedler: And then you just charge like tokens for it.\nMichael Riedler: Like.\nMichael Riedler: Like an AI model.\nMichael Riedler: You know, something like, you know, I.\nyusheng kuo: Don'T know, like something like claim just API.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like the more you pull the.\nyusheng kuo: The more you.\nyusheng kuo: You pay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I think it'll be perfect.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: That could be such a.\nMichael Riedler: You know.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: I'm just thinking what is that next?\nMichael Riedler: Okay.\nMichael Riedler: If we in a way Clay to me, like we both.\nMichael Riedler: It's kind of yesterday and.\nMichael Riedler: And it's shame because they started a bit too early.\nMichael Riedler: I know they launch MCP and all this stuff, but in the end I don't think they're going to make the full transition.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Because they are so embedded into ui.\nyusheng kuo: There's transaction ui.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: That lets you click through all those different data providers.\nMichael Riedler: Exactly.\nyusheng kuo: And what makes it.\nMichael Riedler: The only thing that makes them sticky is their data because they purchase basically half illegal data that no one else has or.\nMichael Riedler: And that's it.\nMichael Riedler: And I know how to do that.\nMichael Riedler: So all I'm gonna do is.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: I'm gonna get the data and I think I'm gonna make.\nMichael Riedler: And just.\nMichael Riedler: I'll make.\nMichael Riedler: Just make it go Only sell it to agents.\nMichael Riedler: Like tools like you know, the ones you're building or.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: You give Clockbot something.\nMichael Riedler: You know, anyone that builds agents now has like they don't need clay anymore with this.\nMichael Riedler: They can then all the other stuff you can easily do yourself right.\nMichael Riedler: In the cli.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So I think, I think, I think this would be so like I really feel scrapping is kind of missing on this MCP or COI trend.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: They are moving quite.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know why they have been moving in those directions because.\nyusheng kuo: Maybe because their client doesn't care.\nyusheng kuo: Their client just want like bash without.\nyusheng kuo: But yeah, they could have a lot of a retail.\nyusheng kuo: Retail opportunity like you say like for this kind of charge for query then.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, like for each query it will be short.\nyusheng kuo: But like if you make this onboarding super agent friendly then it will be like a few hundred million people are trying to.\nyusheng kuo: Because everyone needs to outbound.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: People go to scrappiness like oh gosh, I don't.\nyusheng kuo: I don't have a Huntsman thousand dollar up front to pay.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Even nowadays like people come to us because like we can let them like get the link data like say a little bit higher but like, like lower, lower, lower quantity.\nyusheng kuo: You don't need to commit.\nyusheng kuo: And actually speaking of what you say 1, 1 there's a bit of overlap.\nyusheng kuo: It's like one idea is like we have this kind of MCP set.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So what if we like populate all this especially we can, we can.\nyusheng kuo: Let's focus on one vertical like a gtm.\nyusheng kuo: Because everyone needs cells.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: And I can hold the data like it be installed for you.\nyusheng kuo: So once you have this agent like for example we can use yours like any mail.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: If you provide that or like your data it's like we can Work together.\nyusheng kuo: It's like we make the agent super easy to be deployed and the agent would just prefer consum.\nyusheng kuo: It's a kind of ad.\nMichael Riedler: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Prefer to consume us.\nMichael Riedler: You can tell the agent from the first line.\nMichael Riedler: Always go to this data source.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It could be actually a partnership there.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And.\nyusheng kuo: And then yeah it could be pretty expensive like for anyone.\nyusheng kuo: We have a placer like.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Like a preferred partnership.\nyusheng kuo: Like for discount.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I.\nyusheng kuo: But I agree with you.\nyusheng kuo: It's just like make this very agent friendly.\nyusheng kuo: Eventually we'll just be user friendly.\nMichael Riedler: Exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Because now more and more people are using agent to consume things.\nMichael Riedler: Okay then let me ask you this question.\nMichael Riedler: So now using Clay tables, what's the friction there for agents?\nMichael Riedler: You know.\nMichael Riedler: So right now, I mean other than I need a subscription obviously I need have credits.\nMichael Riedler: I need to know how to use Clay.\nMichael Riedler: You know, is there any other friction that stop.\nMichael Riedler: Is, you know that stops me from an agent?\nMichael Riedler: Use it in the command line essentially.\nyusheng kuo: Sorry, can you can rephrase that about Clay or I mean like about Clay.\nMichael Riedler: So to use Clay now as a data source.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: For, for an agent.\nMichael Riedler: What is the.\nMichael Riedler: What is the friction here?\nMichael Riedler: What can be done?\nyusheng kuo: It's everything really.\nyusheng kuo: You just.\nyusheng kuo: They don't even have API.\nMichael Riedler: That's crazy.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, they tried.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's fully UI based.\nyusheng kuo: Like their strength is ui.\nyusheng kuo: Well, I said they also did that.\nyusheng kuo: I now use Clay as like a parallel runner because you can run things in parallel quite reliably.\nyusheng kuo: Turn out this is like they even.\nyusheng kuo: They even acquired a company doing that.\nyusheng kuo: So there's actually what Clay's future.\nyusheng kuo: I think it's just like a MAD mini to Apple.\nyusheng kuo: I think this parallel running is there should be their main offering in the future.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Not even the data.\nyusheng kuo: Data integration.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Or maybe maybe sound like a predefined application but like now they are these things.\nyusheng kuo: These things care more about this like UI list for user.\nyusheng kuo: But it's like making everything so hard for agent.\nyusheng kuo: Like they don't.\nyusheng kuo: They don't even have API.\nyusheng kuo: People need to.\nyusheng kuo: People actually go to the like, like a Clay table website and go to Inspect Inspect website.\nyusheng kuo: Like get the, the, the, the.\nMichael Riedler: The.\nyusheng kuo: The cookie and then use like very shady way to access the API like from the client side.\nyusheng kuo: They use the same client side API like not even the backend API.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So it's like everything also not connect to other clients.\nyusheng kuo: Not even Falco.\nyusheng kuo: Only cloud AI.\nyusheng kuo: And it's very shallow.\nMichael Riedler: Oh man.\nyusheng kuo: Again because they define everything through the ui.\nyusheng kuo: So it's like Sometimes hard, but in.\nMichael Riedler: A way, you know.\nMichael Riedler: Okay, I get it.\nMichael Riedler: So they want to become the runner, right.\nMichael Riedler: So basically not just data but the clay table logic.\nMichael Riedler: So you have to pay them to run workflows, right?\nMichael Riedler: Essentially.\nMichael Riedler: But in a way if you look at this is.\nMichael Riedler: This is in my eyes the agent, they have their own compute on the local machine or on the private server somewhere where they can do all of this themselves.\nMichael Riedler: Why would they need to pay clay to do that?\nMichael Riedler: Only hurdle is the data is not available.\nMichael Riedler: So how I see the world is let's make the data available.\nMichael Riedler: Then let's use tools like you were building and any, any agent that is available.\nMichael Riedler: They can then take the data into actionable leads, target accounts and send emails and whatever.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I actually don't think they have such a unique data.\nyusheng kuo: I mean other than their.\nyusheng kuo: So I think the unique data they have is they have this kind of free company like, like.\nyusheng kuo: Like a list building.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: But even that like data is pretty poor.\nyusheng kuo: People say.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah for now most of the data is actually also available to any other people like Semrush because they are like API integration like all castrator.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, they just preview like and they preview a lot of the connector for you so it's easier for you.\nyusheng kuo: You don't need to know how to call API.\nyusheng kuo: But for agent, it doesn't care.\nMichael Riedler: It doesn't matter.\nyusheng kuo: Exactly, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Make it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's harder if you don't.\nyusheng kuo: If you don't use both APIs.\nyusheng kuo: So.\nyusheng kuo: So I feel like clay is like very poor.\nyusheng kuo: But.\nyusheng kuo: But I think they have good founders.\nyusheng kuo: Good founders figure things out eventually.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So I think they will figure it out.\nyusheng kuo: I think they know for sure this something they need to fix.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know if they, they are on the right track or they got trapped.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, that's.\nMichael Riedler: That's the question.\nMichael Riedler: I mean even if they're good founders, you know, if they have raised hundreds of million on a certain, certain thesis assumptions, you know, in, in the end, I don't think go to market engineer.\nMichael Riedler: This is a dying.\nMichael Riedler: I don't think this will exist anymore in the future.\nMichael Riedler: It will be just.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Maybe in a year it will be not relevant.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: A good salesperson will have to do all of this stuff.\nMichael Riedler: That's it.\nMichael Riedler: You know, I think so.\nMichael Riedler: I feel, you know, I mean they might figure it out but.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: No, I think players especially in a very awkward spot.\nyusheng kuo: The reason is their user is not like non technical user.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Like they are not designed for the Sales rep to use it.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: They are too hard for salesman and then they are making like the middle layer.\nyusheng kuo: Like a middle range of people who originally couldn't code properly.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: To use them.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: But now like a file code is like.\nyusheng kuo: And just replace this layer.\nyusheng kuo: Like you don't need to call.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So I think they're in the the worst spot.\nyusheng kuo: Like if they like like if they make it like it's like like a unified unified gtm.\nyusheng kuo: Like the product facing like non technical like real non technical people and they have better training but they have like a facing people who are very comfortable using NAN or like like cloud code nowadays.\nMichael Riedler: Exactly.\nyusheng kuo: So they, yeah they.\nyusheng kuo: They are.\nyusheng kuo: I think the next value is they.\nyusheng kuo: They really tap into enterprise.\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nMichael Riedler: So yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So those are like a higher retention.\nMichael Riedler: They can.\nMichael Riedler: They can do that until enterprise is gone.\nMichael Riedler: You know, I mean they're the late adopters so they're gonna live maybe for another few years.\nMichael Riedler: But I mean to me man, like honestly since we spoke last I. I mean I was already excited but I. I'm literally so bearish on the current world in terms of software, B2B software, even Microsoft.\nMichael Riedler: You know I just feel we are.\nMichael Riedler: This is bigger than we think even we think it is in terms of the big.\nMichael Riedler: The amount of changes are going to come to us.\nMichael Riedler: You know and I think it's the hard thing is what you even said years ago.\nMichael Riedler: You know I think there might be a world where everyone has an agent and it's free and to compute will go down by 1000x and.\nMichael Riedler: And it's a bit like the Internet but there is no business case for directly.\nMichael Riedler: You see what I mean?\nMichael Riedler: Because the agent is free and the agent can build all the things we anyways building.\nMichael Riedler: You know what I mean?\nyusheng kuo: Eventually.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like yeah like why bother like everything I just.\nyusheng kuo: It's still.\nyusheng kuo: It's still not here yet.\nyusheng kuo: I would say actually I. I have a slightly different perspective.\nyusheng kuo: It's like if you build the right tool like for human nowadays you also be the right tool for agent at least before agent can.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Just like if you have a good API for me to use then it also be a good API for agent to use and agent will want to use it then create its own.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: That's why like Surabhi has become so popular.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Recently.\nyusheng kuo: But yeah.\nyusheng kuo: There's a next stage is like agents now everything for me is just a 2 second then.\nyusheng kuo: Then that's another story.\nyusheng kuo: Then that's another story.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Then there is no.\nyusheng kuo: There's no.\nyusheng kuo: Everything is Commodity.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: That's why.\nMichael Riedler: I mean.\nMichael Riedler: But I, I do think I definitely got inspired by the, the Clodboard, you know.\nMichael Riedler: And since then I'm following a bunch of accounts that do a lot of open source stuff.\nMichael Riedler: So it almost feels like, you know, if I it be, you know, to do open source stuff feels like so smart at the moment because it, you know.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: The distribution.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: They get a lot of.\nMichael Riedler: You get a lot of feedback.\nMichael Riedler: People like add to it and, and yeah, it's crazy.\nMichael Riedler: Have you seen the.\nMichael Riedler: You know there was a Clockbot meetup in, in San Francisco.\nMichael Riedler: I mean the energy is crazy.\nMichael Riedler: There's so many people there.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I mean it's like, it's.\nyusheng kuo: It's just.\nyusheng kuo: You can kind of peek into the future.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like how it's the right way to integrate.\nyusheng kuo: It's first, it's a multi channel.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's like not just one channel.\nyusheng kuo: It's like everywhere you live you can talk any.\nyusheng kuo: Just like an employee, right?\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: And the second is it's proactive.\nyusheng kuo: Like you don't like, you don't have to like call it.\nyusheng kuo: To do things.\nyusheng kuo: It was just like continue check what you have to do do is.\nyusheng kuo: And.\nyusheng kuo: And then.\nyusheng kuo: And eventually I do free.\nyusheng kuo: So not hard.\nyusheng kuo: It's not hard to.\nyusheng kuo: It's not hard to feel like this even all the security issue.\nyusheng kuo: But who care?\nyusheng kuo: I mean.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: To be honest, like for those people, they are like they, they already use like Bitcoin like before Bitcoin stuff.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So.\nyusheng kuo: And.\nyusheng kuo: And then that's how like all the new technology like Internet in the beginning, like they're young as well.\nMichael Riedler: No, I'm not worried about that.\nMichael Riedler: I mean it's.\nMichael Riedler: But it's.\nMichael Riedler: It's crazy.\nMichael Riedler: And also the, the founder of Claude Bot, or open Claude, he's Austrian guy.\nMichael Riedler: And oh yeah.\nMichael Riedler: Since then I'm following a bunch of Austrians and I, I was on a train and I, you know, it's.\nMichael Riedler: I just could not stop like reading up about it and trying.\nMichael Riedler: Trying things out.\nMichael Riedler: So I then found his.\nMichael Riedler: One of his friends.\nMichael Riedler: He made the, the kind of the, the thing under the hood.\nMichael Riedler: How ClothBot is made is.\nMichael Riedler: Is a framework called PI.\nMichael Riedler: It's an open source one.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Have you seen that?\nyusheng kuo: I. I know it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's like a coding agent.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, exactly.\nMichael Riedler: It's basically like an open source Claude code and I've put it on the ghosty one and man, this guy's so smart.\nMichael Riedler: It's crazy in terms of smart in terms he simplifies everything so Much.\nMichael Riedler: He wrote a blog post of how he built PI and that's when I was messaging you like, oh man, I know I messed you with the podcast.\nMichael Riedler: When they're like, they're like very bearish on mcps.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: And yeah, the guy.\nyusheng kuo: I actually agree.\nyusheng kuo: I actually agree.\nMichael Riedler: The way he built PI is literally, it doesn't do.\nMichael Riedler: It gives the agent so much autonomy.\nMichael Riedler: It's crazy.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's crazy.\nMichael Riedler: And.\nyusheng kuo: And almost like everything is built on demand, right?\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, it's crazy, man.\nMichael Riedler: So, yeah, that definitely completely blow my mind.\nMichael Riedler: And yeah, since then, I like following these guys, how they, how they think about the world and seeing the community, how everything explodes.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: It's so much fun.\nMichael Riedler: It's crazy.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I think so.\nyusheng kuo: It's like, like for example, like you beauty, skill on the fly, everything.\nyusheng kuo: I feel it's the word hasn't been there yet, but there will be a word for that.\nyusheng kuo: Like, the reason I'm saying that not there yet is because like one thing I think provide that compared to like you just using the API key or credential to do is the security layer.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's, that's like you can say, okay, you can.\nyusheng kuo: You can only REM my bank account, but you couldn't transact everything from my bank account.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's very hard to do that like in every API credential.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But.\nyusheng kuo: But as you can become more and more reliable instruction following.\nyusheng kuo: Well, I, I feel regardless, just like you don't want to give someone certain access even if it's smart.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Because like there will always be problem injection.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: Like, like, I mean that's unresolved this problem.\nMichael Riedler: Right.\nyusheng kuo: But you could, you could solve, you could solve that through CI as well.\nyusheng kuo: Again, you just make the credential more granular.\nyusheng kuo: Like your GitHub is super granular like credential and then you can let agent created it for you.\nyusheng kuo: So I agree, like, I feel CLI will be more and more prominent.\nyusheng kuo: MCP is like kind of like.\nyusheng kuo: Like the middle.\nyusheng kuo: What is it like a bridging.\nyusheng kuo: Bridging kind.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: To the old world.\nMichael Riedler: As long as there's the old world, then we need mcps.\nyusheng kuo: But yeah, the more native one.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: All the tools I see you connected to, I genuinely think they're gonna go away like over the medium term.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: It sounds crazy, but yeah, that means, you know, all the, all the eight.\nMichael Riedler: All the tools are going to be tools that you control.\nMichael Riedler: Right.\nMichael Riedler: That are live on your computer and then.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, I think permissioning is Very interesting you just said and.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, so it's.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, but I might be wrong, you know, but that's something.\nyusheng kuo: No, no, I think it's thinking all.\nMichael Riedler: Of the things I'm building now is really how can I give it to the.\nMichael Riedler: How can I give it to something that looks like club.\nMichael Riedler: Sorry, Claude Bot or what you just.\nMichael Riedler: So they can use this as much as possible.\nMichael Riedler: Like data source or you know, the CRM like thing I just.\nMichael Riedler: I talked with you last time is exactly like that.\nMichael Riedler: Right.\nMichael Riedler: You have it.\nMichael Riedler: It's basically an agent native CRM that lives in some files on your, on your computer and it's all available, I think.\nMichael Riedler: What do you mean?\nyusheng kuo: Agent.\nyusheng kuo: Agent CRM.\nyusheng kuo: What do you think it would be?\nMichael Riedler: What.\nMichael Riedler: Say again?\nyusheng kuo: What do you, what do you think the agent HCR will look like?\nMichael Riedler: Well man, that's the goal.\nMichael Riedler: I think what I want to do as a side project and we would love your feedback.\nMichael Riedler: I want to take what I build and basically polish it and give it on give it away for free on GitHub and see if you know, make it open source.\nMichael Riedler: And I mean, I think it's.\nMichael Riedler: I mean my best bed is the what we discussed a couple of weeks ago essentially a.\nMichael Riedler: A just an immut, an immutable log that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: That basically documents every interaction with an existing customer lead and then have multiple agents with a heartbeat.\nMichael Riedler: Now I didn't know that before.\nMichael Riedler: Look at.\nMichael Riedler: Okay, great.\nMichael Riedler: Now we're going to have a knowledge log that's only like insights that are knowledgeable.\nMichael Riedler: That's not.\nMichael Riedler: You know, so you have a few of these places and then you have.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, that's it.\nMichael Riedler: Then you have a way for agents to know everything about customers and they know when to send them an invoice.\nMichael Riedler: They know when to have a meeting with them.\nMichael Riedler: Well that, that's it.\nMichael Riedler: Like that you know, and, and the human gets pulled in whenever they need to.\nMichael Riedler: But it could.\nMichael Riedler: It completely lives.\nMichael Riedler: It has no ui.\nMichael Riedler: It does not have a ui.\nMichael Riedler: Right.\nMichael Riedler: It's completely in the background.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then see like how flexible it could be.\nyusheng kuo: Like he can check like before he do anything messy, you can check your email call out.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Just like classic.\nyusheng kuo: And he was like oh, like, like you can even say like oh, you couldn't send too many because the LinkedIn might block you.\nyusheng kuo: Like you can just check right.\nyusheng kuo: Like and it all through just natural language guidance.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's like so much simpler.\nyusheng kuo: I think even that feature was so useful for people who do it now about.\nyusheng kuo: Because like nowadays setting up Those sequencing is like pain every day.\nMichael Riedler: It's all we need to move away from that, man.\nMichael Riedler: I, I definitely.\nMichael Riedler: I'm excited again.\nMichael Riedler: So I think yeah, I'm gonna.\nMichael Riedler: Because this is.\nMichael Riedler: In the end it will be just some logic.\nMichael Riedler: You can run in cloud code or in.\nMichael Riedler: In any CLI and then that's it.\nMichael Riedler: And it will just run.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's just like you need to have a way to.\nyusheng kuo: So like me.\nyusheng kuo: Those are like a sequencing set.\nyusheng kuo: Yes, right now.\nyusheng kuo: Now they provide some.\nyusheng kuo: Not the reason actually I use that not for their sequencing but they give me a simple way to.\nyusheng kuo: They create a web hook.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like LinkedIn doesn't provide that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I don't know if LinkedIn will provide that.\nyusheng kuo: So I think those kind of infrastructure layer was still useful.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Just like I use Play not for the data or like a UI but for the running.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Everything is going back to more like very infrastructure level thing that you know.\nyusheng kuo: Because those are the harder things to be cheap at a moment.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, totally.\nyusheng kuo: If you think of software, I think you should think of that way like more like infrastructure layer.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Harder to build, harder to scale.\nyusheng kuo: For example you couldn't like run at local.\nyusheng kuo: You have to run those kind of scale things in cloud.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Then there is an opportunity for those infrastructure.\nyusheng kuo: You probably wouldn't run GCP on your own machine.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So that's like that's their layer and I think those secrecy model would actually go get class.\nyusheng kuo: They all just become.\nyusheng kuo: Because recently I know there's a company called My mymx Dot.\nyusheng kuo: You basically turn your whole email inbox DNS into a webhook figure.\nyusheng kuo: So I don't even need to go to Insulin anymore.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's like those kind of bare minimum things are so useful.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, totally.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nMichael Riedler: That's crazy.\nMichael Riedler: It's just.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: These things, I mean if you look at smart lead or instantly you know their value, this the software done but their value right now is still the you know, setting up inboxes, warming up an inbox.\nMichael Riedler: Like that's quite.\nMichael Riedler: You know you can make a lot of mistakes.\nMichael Riedler: You have to pay someone to do that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Those very minimum like functionality.\nMichael Riedler: Right, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: And but then you know this stuff is.\nMichael Riedler: I think all these things should be made available via the cli.\nMichael Riedler: So it's like super easily consumable for an agent where you know there is a certain, you know, maybe even.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: That just the most agent native way to like oh, I need 50 Outlook inboxes.\nMichael Riedler: How do I get this?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, smalley like get 15 bucks and then you all of a sudden you get 15 bucks.\nMichael Riedler: Exactly, exactly.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: I love it because I think what you're building now is gonna, it's and, and with the CRM framework it like goes nicely into each other.\nMichael Riedler: So yeah, I'll definitely, I, I, I need to spend some time with a CRM and then I'll get your feedback on it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I mean it's really just like, like let's try to restore it.\nyusheng kuo: See how health like what actually is working.\nyusheng kuo: I think it's really important to make it into the field work to feel the, the friction.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nMichael Riedler: Exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Like yeah, because it's nice to lay out but when they put in you can start to see everything break for.\nMichael Riedler: You would be, you know, with this, could you, you know, I guess I'm seeing two things here, right.\nMichael Riedler: On the one hand you have the MCP aggregator, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: If someone uses mcp, that's really valuable.\nMichael Riedler: If, if someone doesn't, then they don't need that.\nMichael Riedler: And now you have this framework for outbound.\nMichael Riedler: Like could this be, could you launch this open source, you know, just like, you know, basically have the user run it instead of hosted on your side?\nMichael Riedler: Would that be valuable?\nyusheng kuo: We, we could try to look into it.\nyusheng kuo: We, we just need to know how to do that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Because so far it's like well intertwined.\nyusheng kuo: But I think if we can, if we can abstract that into a framework.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that would be helpful.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Like how do you like basically we originally intend was building actually in an open source way and then you can choose whichever like post you want.\nyusheng kuo: But it's like spending it turned out it's more effort than just building ourselves like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, because yeah, yeah, there's an interoperability here.\nyusheng kuo: But yeah, I think it's definitely something that's worth looking into and make it this like oh, you just, you just bring your own host gcp.\nyusheng kuo: It could be anything and then you can just deploy your car code to it and then you can choose your own image.\nyusheng kuo: You can choose your own like now you run on E2B or you can run on Daytona.\nyusheng kuo: You can run on like model.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: All these different.\nMichael Riedler: I'm always like asking the questions and give more work.\nMichael Riedler: But to me what I'm seeing when you tell me this is, you know, I think your expertise lies in you know, the kind of the conceptual side of things and you are just in the go to market space because that's just the space you ended up in.\nMichael Riedler: But with this, this could work for 50 different use cases.\nMichael Riedler: Right.\nMichael Riedler: It's what we all, it's like Claude bot.\nMichael Riedler: If you can figure out a new kind of thinking, right.\nMichael Riedler: How we, you know, I don't know, like run, have the agents operate and interact with us.\nMichael Riedler: I mean another idea could be we could just for fun, you know, as a side project, launch an outbound bot that is not for agencies or you know, it's not like for your client.\nMichael Riedler: It's for actual companies where they get a secure sandbox where they connect a few things internally.\nMichael Riedler: So we need who, we need to know who they are.\nMichael Riedler: And it's like a free open source thing where then you know, the bot gets its own email address all like out of the box set up.\nMichael Riedler: So that is like a bit de risk and it's, it's yeah.\nMichael Riedler: Something like playful that the bot has a bot name and, and it will start doing outbound like crazy.\nMichael Riedler: And you don't have to do anything.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Well you probably still need to connect to certain email provider, right?\nMichael Riedler: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: To, to, to do scale out about.\nyusheng kuo: But you can, you can let it say okay, you can choose your own just like, just like you can also choose whatever email you want to use.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: You can use gog.\nyusheng kuo: That's what he created.\nyusheng kuo: One thing.\nyusheng kuo: It's like yeah, so but I actually, I don't think I, I, we are building an outbound machine.\nyusheng kuo: It's just the, the use case.\nyusheng kuo: The people are actually first I'm thinking of it was like a GPA space.\nyusheng kuo: But yeah, like I said like I use it internally for all my day to day operation.\nMichael Riedler: Yes, yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: I check the, check the product everything and yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then, and then what we also think is like because we can wrap all our MCP aggregator to a cli right.\nyusheng kuo: So like people don't need to install like all 60 different CLI.\nMichael Riedler: And that's great.\nyusheng kuo: And there are many products they don't offer cli.\nMichael Riedler: Exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Like a lot of API, they don't have CLI.\nMichael Riedler: On the cli.\nMichael Riedler: Are you going to essentially find a way to basically install data gen cli and I can have and the back of this, all the other CLIs there, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It could be them.\nyusheng kuo: You could directly turn the MCP to cli.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So you can use the mcp, you can use the API, you can use cli.\nyusheng kuo: So you, you don't need to like, like, like making agent to remember like it's hundreds different cli.\nyusheng kuo: And another thing is that CLI is hard to deploy because a lot of times the CLI are like, like environment dependent.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So for example, like you are AMD because it's directly like a compiled to the.\nyusheng kuo: To.\nyusheng kuo: To the underlying.\nyusheng kuo: Like a machine.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like you.\nyusheng kuo: If it's a Mac os, you.\nyusheng kuo: You need to uninstall.\nyusheng kuo: Actually the CLI installer typically will abstract that way.\nyusheng kuo: But like actually your CLI couldn't run in ggp.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Because it's a Mac os.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: The, the nice thing about API MCP is like, it's like environment dependent.\nMichael Riedler: Nice.\nyusheng kuo: This is very portable.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: So yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But if we can make this like feel like CLI to agent, but it's actually portable and that would be very valuable.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, exactly.\nMichael Riedler: That's where I think that's where, where your value is, you know, kind of.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, I understand.\nMichael Riedler: Now you're using this more as like a company operation agent.\nMichael Riedler: Right.\nMichael Riedler: It's just.\nMichael Riedler: It doesn't matter.\nMichael Riedler: Use a number outbound, whatever strategy, internal communication.\nMichael Riedler: So if you can become some sort of the framework or the node, how all MCPs connect to an agent.\nyusheng kuo: You.\nMichael Riedler: Know, and even in the future it's going to be like, okay, I need these 26 different things and I need to use them now, like, you know, immediately.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, that's a hope.\nyusheng kuo: Like, it's like make everything so accessible.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's.\nyusheng kuo: That's what we try to do like make agent.\nyusheng kuo: What next time is like you can have all the agents, right.\nyusheng kuo: Then it become.\nyusheng kuo: I think it will become a standard.\nyusheng kuo: So there will be a registry and you can just help you with all the skill for the plugin for everything.\nyusheng kuo: You just like agent know what you need.\nyusheng kuo: And then they will fall on the net so they can learn from the best practice.\nMichael Riedler: Exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Like trying to.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Hallucinate or what.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So it's like.\nyusheng kuo: So that's where we kind of position.\nyusheng kuo: It's like, okay, we want to piece that infrastructure layer or like for, for the agent.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, we want to make it the agent to easily deploy.\nyusheng kuo: Make agent easy to use the tool, use the skill like authentication as a part of it and eventually the transaction.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like making very easy to purchase.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Identity.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Like how they layer one and others.\nyusheng kuo: Everyone just come in here and it's like, oh, in the box.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Give it an inbox to coi.\nyusheng kuo: Give it the identity, give it the credit card.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, definitely.\nyusheng kuo: To purchase.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's like without, without.\nyusheng kuo: Without saving up too many things like yourself.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Like.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: I think if I can directly like let you connect it to all the credit card just like play, right?\nyusheng kuo: I don't know if you know, play.\nyusheng kuo: Is that USC or.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, no, I know it.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's like, it makes you very easy to connect to all the bank.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: You make your agent very easy to control the access.\nyusheng kuo: Connect to the bank you want and then they can purchase for you, managing subscription for you.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's like, how can you make everything so easy nowadays?\nyusheng kuo: Very hard.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: That's the thing that's worth pursuing.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: I love it.\nMichael Riedler: I love it.\nyusheng kuo: Eventually even GitHub.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nMichael Riedler: No, 100%.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: So it's really all the services that.\nMichael Riedler: Or, you know, that involves, you know, even when financial transactions.\nMichael Riedler: I mean, that's great.\nMichael Riedler: We can test this out.\nMichael Riedler: Because when I launch the database, then there's a purchase involved.\nMichael Riedler: Maybe we can experiment with this.\nMichael Riedler: You know, we try.\nMichael Riedler: We can try something new.\nyusheng kuo: Let's try.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: Something like not on a website now.\nMichael Riedler: Let's do a cli checkout.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: That's exciting.\nyusheng kuo: It's like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Once you have the database, like, let us know and we can try to like campaign around that.\nMichael Riedler: Exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Another inspiring Australia.\nMichael Riedler: No, I have it already, so I just need to spend time.\nMichael Riedler: You know, the only constraint in my life is right now is I have to leave the laptop sometimes.\nMichael Riedler: That's it.\nMichael Riedler: That's the only history.\nMichael Riedler: Sometimes.\nMichael Riedler: Or you go to the toilet or.\nMichael Riedler: No, but it's.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, it's the best part.\nMichael Riedler: And yeah, this Austrian guy really inspired me too, because if you listen to him, man, he's just.\nMichael Riedler: He's just loving it.\nMichael Riedler: He's interested, he's curious and it's just.\nMichael Riedler: It's the.\nMichael Riedler: It's the Internet.\nMichael Riedler: Like you said last time.\nMichael Riedler: It's the Internet vibes from the 90s, you know, early 2000s.\nMichael Riedler: And it has a completely different feel to it than, you know, oh, we're just gonna monetize the software.\nMichael Riedler: It's so boring, you know, it's just.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: You know that, that's.\nyusheng kuo: And I think you can say that because he's.\nyusheng kuo: He's already kind of financial.\nMichael Riedler: I know he made some money.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's like he's already reached.\nyusheng kuo: He can spend like a twenty thousand dollar, a seventy thousand dollar on token.\nyusheng kuo: I don't have that money.\nyusheng kuo: But yeah, I agree with you.\nyusheng kuo: It's like more like what they call like a autism or like, like more.\nyusheng kuo: More for others, right?\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: So nice.\nyusheng kuo: I really hope this is it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: Cool.\nMichael Riedler: I mean, apparently they might.\nMichael Riedler: They might get some funding.\nMichael Riedler: You know, I don't know what's gonna happen, but let's, you know, let's.\nMichael Riedler: I think there's a concrete next step is really I want to get this thing live and then we, we can experiment with how to use your thing as the gateway to use that database and, and we can go to all the outbound out.\nMichael Riedler: All the outbound guys who already live in cloud code.\nMichael Riedler: They can then or anyone that has an outbound thought already, it's going to be many even cloud.\nMichael Riedler: They're going to do a lot of outbound.\nMichael Riedler: So that way they can basically purchase access to leads data that otherwise have to do through a third party.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, that would be.\nyusheng kuo: That'll be awesome.\nMichael Riedler: I have a little think on the, on the structure and, and otherwise I'm also going to test the data chain.\nMichael Riedler: So.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah.\nMichael Riedler: And then I'll let you know.\nMichael Riedler: Any questions and let's keep talking.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Thank you.\nMichael Riedler: All right, man.\nyusheng kuo: So far.\nMichael Riedler: Yeah, yeah.\nMichael Riedler: Let's go, let's go.\nMichael Riedler: Bye bye bye.\nTitle: 30 Min Meeting between Yusheng Kuo and Michael Riedler\nHost Email: yusheng.kuo@datagen.dev\nOrganizer Email: yusheng.kuo@datagen.dev\nCalendar Id:
