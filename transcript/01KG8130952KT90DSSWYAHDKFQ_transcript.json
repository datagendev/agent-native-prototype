yeah.\nAndrew Osborne: How's it going, man?\nAndrew Osborne: Bro, I'm completely sorry.\nAndrew Osborne: I completely forgot the cause at this time.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, no, no, no problem.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's Saturday morning, so that happens.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I'm sorry, that's my, my, my, my.\nyusheng kuo: The, the, the, the video recording thing is not working on my side the camera, I don't know why, so I couldn't really turn on the camera.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, sorry.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, don't worry about it, man.\nAndrew Osborne: Don't worry about it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAndrew Osborne: How was your week been?\nyusheng kuo: Okay?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, it's a busy, busy week.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, here and there.\nyusheng kuo: What about yours?\nAndrew Osborne: The week was good.\nAndrew Osborne: Yeah.\nAndrew Osborne: Same as you're a bit busy and then.\nAndrew Osborne: Yeah, just I had, I went to like a, an event earlier today and so now I'm just here doing a bit of work, trying to, trying to catch up for the week ahead.\nAndrew Osborne: Just doing some like research because it's quite hard to like spend time researching new things during the week.\nAndrew Osborne: So I like to give myself the weekend to do some research into like new tools that I can use and things like that.\nAndrew Osborne: So I thought it made sense for us to speak, bro.\nAndrew Osborne: But yeah, I'm intrigued to know how you, I'm assuming you came across my profile when you saw my comment maybe on Jacob's post.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think it's Jacob's post.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: About how he, how he do the, the context update.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, I'll just kind of reach out.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I'm.\nAndrew Osborne: I'm intrigued to.\nAndrew Osborne: So, no, so I guess I'll, I'll begin.\nAndrew Osborne: I'll give you a rundown of like what, what I'm doing and what you might not know.\nAndrew Osborne: So pretty much right now working at Understory, which is like a go to market agency.\nAndrew Osborne: So pretty much what we're doing is we're working with like B2B SAS firms, tech firms using like Cold Outbound, Whether it's email, LinkedIn phone to help them generate like top of funnel, so generate interested leads and booked meetings.\nAndrew Osborne: So we're using loads of like, you know, tools like instantly clay all of these tools to like full leads and rich leads and do all of these cool things and that's great.\nyusheng kuo: However.\nAndrew Osborne: Since I came on the team two months ago, I have quite a technical background, so I used to be a software engineer a few years ago.\nAndrew Osborne: So yeah, a big part, A big part of what I'm trying to do is think how we can just make our work more efficient.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nAndrew Osborne: So yeah, integrating the right tools and a big part of that is Using like Claude.\nAndrew Osborne: But what I can see anyway is using Claude code for a lot of the strategy.\nAndrew Osborne: So like pulling intake forms, pulling kickoff call transcripts, using that to do like research into like who we're going to be reaching out to.\nAndrew Osborne: And so my whole aim is like literally bro, we do a kickoff call of a client, the calls transcribed and straight away like Claude co can start working away and like suggesting yeah different like campaign angles based off of my best practices.\nAndrew Osborne: So yeah I'm trying to put together skills which like follow my best practices of how I like to write code emails for example.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nAndrew Osborne: And just get me from zero, get me from zero to one a lot quicker.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree with you.\nyusheng kuo: Like I.\nyusheng kuo: Well we are building tool, we're building products.\nyusheng kuo: So we are also trying to.\nyusheng kuo: I mean we're not like I think our like you have to serve different clients.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So it's really important to try to automate as much as possible.\nyusheng kuo: One is because that would make sure everyone can focusing on things that has high risk leverage.\nyusheng kuo: The second thing is the more automation or system put in place the more, the more it's predictable.\nyusheng kuo: You have the trace of how things went wrong whenever there's a thing on our end.\nyusheng kuo: Because what we are doing is we need to keep track of all this usage from user, from our call to the users, whether it's an interview or just a discovery call.\nyusheng kuo: And also we want to be able to identify what's our ideal icp.\nyusheng kuo: So being able to put in place also the reason I'm saying that is because we are also using cloud code to do this type of stuff.\nyusheng kuo: We are using it to help us to get the transcript.\nyusheng kuo: We're using it to help us to summarize the user behavior every day.\nyusheng kuo: And I can actually show you that.\nyusheng kuo: And that's all kind of a combined into cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: And I think cloud code is just really the view I'm seeing.\nyusheng kuo: Cloud code like you say you create this kind of skill.\nyusheng kuo: It's almost kind of like a software.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: It's like a small app living on just like an app store on iPhone.\nyusheng kuo: I feel like this kind of skill MCP or plugin app on top of cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: Cloud co becomes this kind of operating system especially for a knowledge worker.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So that's why we are so bullish on one thing.\nyusheng kuo: The reason we kind of push it, what we are doing is like one thing we see is like KAU seems to have still very like a personal computer and very manual.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like you develop some kind of Skill and it can do some kind of transcript summary, right.\nyusheng kuo: Or do some kind of a outbound angle or email creation.\nyusheng kuo: But you do want it to be more autonomous, more alike.\nyusheng kuo: So whenever there's an incoming of the transcript, you don't need to go ahead like a spin it up.\nyusheng kuo: The reason I'm saying that is I used to do that.\nyusheng kuo: I. I used to like slash update user behavior and I get a report, but sometimes I forget and I don't.\nyusheng kuo: I lose the track of the days like a user behavior.\nyusheng kuo: So we try to say, okay, how can we make this agent is already so powerful living within cloud code and be able to apply everywhere.\nyusheng kuo: So I can kind of show you a little bit of what it is.\nAndrew Osborne: Please do.\nAndrew Osborne: I'd like to get.\nAndrew Osborne: If you could give me just a quick summary now what do you guys do?\nAndrew Osborne: So I can see you're an engineer at datagen.\nAndrew Osborne: Could you give me a bit of a background exactly what data Gen is where you guys help your end users.\nAndrew Osborne: So I can just begin to understand.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So a very quick summary is we are agent deployment platform for cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: So we help you.\nyusheng kuo: I'm not sure like you said, you haven't started to use it, but one of the very powerful primitive in cloud code is called custom agent.\nyusheng kuo: So you can basically create this agent in like a markdown file, right?\nyusheng kuo: And then this agent can use all type of tool in your cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: You can use mcp, you can use skill and it can basically do a little bit just like a cloud bot.\nyusheng kuo: This agent can just do anything.\nyusheng kuo: It depends on what time the tool gets given.\nyusheng kuo: It can access all the contacts the main cloud code can access.\nyusheng kuo: It can access that repository, but like I said, most of them living locally.\nyusheng kuo: So we want to be able to deploy that.\nyusheng kuo: So it can become like you can use email to interact with it.\nyusheng kuo: You can, you can use like terragrant to interact with it.\nyusheng kuo: You can actually let it run on schedule every day aam and you can let it receive webhook.\nyusheng kuo: So whenever something like some event happened or like your clay finish, right, you send a web hook to your agent and then your agent will start to analyze your clay, whether it is working correctly or not.\nyusheng kuo: Or like just like make it deployable.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: It's like you have an app locally on local host.\nyusheng kuo: Now you want to deploy that so everyone can access it.\nyusheng kuo: Everyone you allow will be able to access it and they can run autonomously.\nAndrew Osborne: Okay, interesting.\nAndrew Osborne: Okay, cool.\nAndrew Osborne: That makes sense.\nAndrew Osborne: That makes sense.\nAndrew Osborne: Yeah.\nAndrew Osborne: I mean I guess we could start by walking through Some use cases and then bounce ideas from there.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, 100%.\nyusheng kuo: I would just use my, my cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: So here on my.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know, let me know if you can see my screen.\nyusheng kuo: Probably wait one second.\nAndrew Osborne: I can see it, but it's a bit.\nAndrew Osborne: I can see it, but it's a little bit blurry.\nAndrew Osborne: Yeah, a little bit blurry.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Just one.\nyusheng kuo: Give it probably two, three seconds.\nAndrew Osborne: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Better now.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So here, let me first show you the role.\nyusheng kuo: So whenever you type, like for example, that once you get into cloud, right Whenever you type this slash agent, right.\nyusheng kuo: It will actually help you to create this new agent.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so you can see I already have a lot of agent like MCP Discovery agent.\nyusheng kuo: Hey Rich reply agent.\nyusheng kuo: And on the left is what I actually this is the.\nyusheng kuo: The meeting summarize agent and you can view the agent.\nyusheng kuo: You can have the description of.\nyusheng kuo: It's like a bit of a skill.\nyusheng kuo: He can.\nyusheng kuo: The description of what this agent would do that will be sent to the model and then what type of tool this agent can use and whatever model and you can even have like a skill, like whatever skill or whatever hook this agent can use.\nyusheng kuo: So this is called like a sub custom agent.\nyusheng kuo: And on the left here it is actually just basically this markdown file that's in like I rendered that so it's easier to read.\nyusheng kuo: You can see this agent.\nyusheng kuo: You can just basically cloud would generate this for you.\nyusheng kuo: Like you just describe what kind of agent you want and then cloud would describe with you and then you can easily ask, okay, this is not what I want.\nyusheng kuo: Update it.\nyusheng kuo: So unlike traditional NAN or even CO automation, this is very fast to develop and iterate.\nyusheng kuo: And not only that, you can do things that sometimes are very hard to qualify, right?\nyusheng kuo: Like help me to best understand this problem.\nyusheng kuo: It's like very hard to qualify.\nyusheng kuo: But like this agent be able to do it.\nyusheng kuo: And because he can also access all the scripts in your repository, so he can also execute the script, not just the tool.\nyusheng kuo: So here's an example.\nyusheng kuo: First I wanted to accept the input which is Firefly's webhook.\nyusheng kuo: So I just give it a Firebuy webhook payload from their website and then you say okay, this is expected payload format and you should extract the meeting id.\nyusheng kuo: So that's the first thing.\nyusheng kuo: So use this meeting ID to.\nyusheng kuo: Actually I, I asked you to use this script to download my meeting.\nyusheng kuo: So I develop.\nyusheng kuo: I basically if I coded this script to download the fireflies through the Fireflies mcp.\nyusheng kuo: So one, one way for the we Will have like a MCP gateway so we can easily deploy and this MCP gateway app that can be used both as a tool but also as a.\nyusheng kuo: Like I'm not sure if you have heard the code mode.\nyusheng kuo: So you can use it in Python that basically as an API so you can actually create that.\nyusheng kuo: We can later on go into how this script is created but you can see it actually would be able to execute.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then so it doesn't really like because sometimes the transcript is long, right.\nyusheng kuo: You don't want to just use the MCP tool to return the whole thing to the context window by saving that out.\nyusheng kuo: You don't.\nyusheng kuo: You don't waste that.\nyusheng kuo: And then I say okay, then.\nyusheng kuo: Then after this summary has been done, you will save it to here and then I will want you to analyze the participant first.\nyusheng kuo: Because sometimes my meeting is with my colleague.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Sometimes I'm with my prospects like or user.\nyusheng kuo: I say okay, if it's internal word meeting you should try to prioritize it to do extraction like whenever the participant including me or like Jeremy.\nyusheng kuo: Then this is internal team discussion.\nyusheng kuo: Like it's not like outside work.\nyusheng kuo: So just focusing on to do.\nyusheng kuo: But if it's a prospect or external meeting, right.\nyusheng kuo: Try to extract their pain point.\nyusheng kuo: This is like anyone not including.\nyusheng kuo: If there's anyone that's not yet in with Jeremy then we should do that.\nyusheng kuo: And then he would say okay for three A like what type of external internal warning meeting will look like.\nyusheng kuo: And then that's kind of a like basically it's output format what it should be like.\nyusheng kuo: And then the step 3B will be for prospect meeting.\nyusheng kuo: Like I ask you to follow this format focus focusing on this.\nyusheng kuo: And finally like send some summary to Discord.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And you can see this kind of Discord meeting format.\nyusheng kuo: I would want it to do this.\nyusheng kuo: And eventually I ask you to do just use the call to send a webhook to Discord.\nyusheng kuo: So our team can see the meeting summary as a very high level.\nyusheng kuo: But also we have the raw data.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And then I would say finally also transcript this summary to my transcript summary.\nyusheng kuo: So I have the context already being updated as a summary level.\nyusheng kuo: So it's very important that your contacts does not always have the raw data.\nyusheng kuo: You should have this kind of hierarchy so that model can easily like only needed to when it's only needed to go to the row transcript.\nyusheng kuo: So you can pre qualify your context like hierarchy and then use the hierarchy to help you to know how to summarize.\nAndrew Osborne: So what do you mean by that?\nAndrew Osborne: Sorry, the Hierarchy.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So I don't know if you've read.\nyusheng kuo: I think there's a guy's article is pretty interested.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, his call was this guy.\nyusheng kuo: And this guy.\nyusheng kuo: So one of his toes I think is pretty good.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Basically he has this kind of a pure level, right?\nyusheng kuo: It's like very high level.\nyusheng kuo: It's like basically context like a summary, right?\nyusheng kuo: Like call bot.\nyusheng kuo: He had this kind of a daily like a roll log everywhere but also have this kind of summary of what's happening right now and then also like constitution of the overall principle.\nyusheng kuo: So your model like only need to go to like very low when they have need to get like a citation of particular word that the clients say.\nyusheng kuo: But otherwise when, if you ask it to say okay, what, what, what's our recent transcript pattern?\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: They shouldn't go just directly to raw transcript every time.\nyusheng kuo: They should be able to come into this kind of summarize level.\nyusheng kuo: Like even, even, even in like Joe's, Jacob's article, he mentioned that, right?\nyusheng kuo: He said, I think.\nyusheng kuo: He say, yeah, here this is a odd post you, you mentioned and actually Joe already kind of say, do you have a middle summarization and synthesis step and pull relevant bit info.\nyusheng kuo: So the point of that is you have this kind of a middle step.\nyusheng kuo: It depends on how many steps you want.\nyusheng kuo: But you have this summarization step.\nyusheng kuo: So the model tried to read the summarization, get the information it wants.\nyusheng kuo: So like summarization is like a description of your skill, right?\nyusheng kuo: So model can read a lot of them for like a very high level thing, but whenever needed because there's a hyperlink to the lowest level like transcript so they can still go into the transcript, pull the certain citation, for example.\nyusheng kuo: So that's why you can see actually this process should be codified.\nyusheng kuo: You should try to systemize this context update even for transcript.\nyusheng kuo: Then using this agent is very simple because you can just change it along the way.\nyusheng kuo: And one way I found is try to use skill.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know if it's here, but by using the skill to help you to further summarize the transcript, you can actually modularize the skill.\nyusheng kuo: So whenever your skill get updated, your summarization become better and better.\nyusheng kuo: So that's why I feel like this kind of the way of building clau code like build your whole kauko repository like a software with that kind of dependency.\nyusheng kuo: You're like your transcript should also your agent should have the tool dependency, but also like a skill dependency.\nyusheng kuo: So whenever your skill just like a package get upgraded, your Agent get upgraded too.\nyusheng kuo: All your agent that's used that skill get upgraded.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so that's what I mean.\nyusheng kuo: Like the, you should have this kind of summary as the middle level to give you more of a high level understanding of this customer but also have the citation to the result.\nyusheng kuo: So that's like the agent description.\nyusheng kuo: You can see how easy you can create that, right?\nyusheng kuo: It's very hard actually to do it in like how many steps you have to do.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: And then whenever you want to modify anything, it's very hard to modify here I would just say hey, I don't like this think these are modify and then just change the description.\nyusheng kuo: And it's very easy to Audi right?\nyusheng kuo: Because it's just English.\nyusheng kuo: So anyone in your team can kind of domain expert can come in and say oh this is not right.\nyusheng kuo: This is not a good principle.\nyusheng kuo: Unlike like a python code, right?\nyusheng kuo: Like or like reading in LangChain and you say hey can you help me to review.\nyusheng kuo: If the prompt is right they have to like navigate all these different prompt position or your team lead can just come in and then just say okay this, this, this meeting classification is not.\nyusheng kuo: How is that doesn't cover some kind of age cases try to improve and then they can even come in to improve that.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Not just you because it's just English.\nyusheng kuo: So that's like create very good parity.\nyusheng kuo: Like anyone that can speak English can modify the agent behavior.\nyusheng kuo: So that's, that's very powerful.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, but that's like agent part and then here this is kind of an output of that.\nyusheng kuo: So I so just, just so I'm.\nAndrew Osborne: Understanding before you move on, You see what you had something there where you were calling it download the transcripts.\nAndrew Osborne: Where was that?\nyusheng kuo: Oh yes.\nAndrew Osborne: I think you had the, the local.\nAndrew Osborne: Why were you doing it that way?\nAndrew Osborne: Because I'm sure you could just call the API direct know.\nAndrew Osborne: Could you, could you just tell the agent to call the Fireflies API and download the transcript.\nAndrew Osborne: Why exactly are you calling a hardcoded Python script out of interest?\nyusheng kuo: So first is fast, right?\nyusheng kuo: Like because like download itself should be quite mechanical.\nyusheng kuo: Like there's no intelligence really needed to just download the intelligence is like okay, extract the meeting ID and oh, you can see.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know why the markdown doesn't show but you can see actually here I have a skill called prospect extraction skill.\nyusheng kuo: And then if you go to the scripts download under the hood.\nyusheng kuo: Yes, this is actually calling the API and I use our MCP to do that.\nyusheng kuo: But yes, it's just calling the API to call the script.\nyusheng kuo: You can actually just describe it as well.\nyusheng kuo: But you have to give it a skill to say, okay, you should code to this API.\nyusheng kuo: What I found is because this is a very simple step.\nyusheng kuo: One is it's simple, the other is I want it to be reliable.\nyusheng kuo: Writing code is still way more reliable for this kind of very mechanical thing.\nyusheng kuo: And then because our team doesn't need to know how this be downloaded, it's like they don't care as long as it be downloaded, that's fine.\nyusheng kuo: So I try to abstract that away.\nyusheng kuo: So that's always kind of this trade off.\nyusheng kuo: How do you.\nyusheng kuo: Because if you want to go scale, right, like say process 10,000 row of table, like it's very inefficient.\nyusheng kuo: You just ask the agent to write code on the fly if you know how you want to do it.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nAndrew Osborne: Yeah, no, 100%.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's like every time I just need to call this curl, like code this API, download it to this specific folder, then I can just ask like a Karl code to basically create a tool for yourself to do that.\nyusheng kuo: And that's where the.\nyusheng kuo: That's why I just kind of the.\nAndrew Osborne: Firefighter download and that script literally just that script is just like a request is called API, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, pretty much.\nyusheng kuo: I can show you.\nyusheng kuo: One thing I didn't particularly mention that to not sidetrack is in Datagen you have all this MCP server that you can add.\nyusheng kuo: There's MCP registry, we have some building MCP and you can just add whatever MCP you want.\nyusheng kuo: And any MCP here can be used in your code.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So here you just use this client.\nyusheng kuo: So I can say I execute this tool MCP Firefly, get summary.\nyusheng kuo: So that's become very powerful is because agent can know whatever tool through our MCP so he can know like it doesn't need to go to like read the documentation, anything because it's just MCP tool and it doesn't need to go to read the whole result itself and then to save like copy and paste to save it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So that's like.\nyusheng kuo: But under the hood this basically this execute tool would call this mzp and this MCP called API to do that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So that's how this is done.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then I actually just ask to do it.\nyusheng kuo: And one thing I would say is try to have this kind of make your tool almost like a CLI tool.\nyusheng kuo: You can see I have this kind of add argument for meeting ID URL.\nyusheng kuo: So my agent can use his CLI like a Python to easily change the URL, change the meeting id, change the JSON.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So that's like another thing in terms of when you're trying to create a tool or like a script in your agent to make it do scale thing, do things at scale.\nyusheng kuo: Like I can actually literally ask my agent to spin up a clay run and have another agent to monitor my spin round the clay run.\nyusheng kuo: So that can give me the scale.\nyusheng kuo: My agent become almost like a human being, like calling all these different transcript.\nyusheng kuo: Sorry, scripts to do things at scale.\nAndrew Osborne: Are you guys using clay?\nyusheng kuo: No, we don't, but a lot of our user kind of using clay and then like Jeremy, I don't know if you know Jeremy, he's kind of working with us now.\nyusheng kuo: Jeremy Ross.\nAndrew Osborne: Oh yes, yes.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So he's like a huge power clay user and he's doing a lot of crazy things on data gen with clay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, like basically like reading all the clay table, like metadata column by column.\nyusheng kuo: So he like clay, like your cloud can know what clay you created.\nyusheng kuo: Like basically pulling all these contacts.\nAndrew Osborne: Okay, so he's reading clay tables.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, basically.\nAndrew Osborne: Interesting is that with the clay mcp.\nyusheng kuo: Clay doesn't have MCP open for others.\nyusheng kuo: But you know, people nowadays know how to API through the client.\nyusheng kuo: I know what you mean.\nAndrew Osborne: Yeah, he's basically like just inspecting the element, looking at the request and turning that into.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: That's how people are kind of hacking around and then there are many people are doing that nowadays.\nyusheng kuo: But he can just like wrap it as MCP tool on data gen very easily.\nyusheng kuo: So like the, the, the agent can see it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, that's the point is like, that's actually the powerful stuff of this agent.\nyusheng kuo: It's like if you go to like some random agent platform, a lot of times they don't even have this kind of code node.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: This becomes almost like your code node in your nan, for example.\nyusheng kuo: But this can have all this different library that's installed and it will still be working and that can help you to scale your agent.\nyusheng kuo: Your agent don't need to wait or don't need to write any kind of script on the fly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so that's like very.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, very useful thing.\nyusheng kuo: So that's why I'm so bullish on this agent on Kako.\nyusheng kuo: And then their harness is so good, like they take so little step to accomplish all these different things like reliably.\nyusheng kuo: That's, that's insane.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so on, on the right, so you can see like, okay, what type of thing like that's what I feel like.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, actually the thing you mentioned like, like monitor the meeting transcript or monitor your campaign can also be described here.\nyusheng kuo: So you have a standardized, documented way to say how we should analyze the campaign.\nyusheng kuo: And this documentation can be accessed across all your team.\nyusheng kuo: And this documentation is not only as a documentation, it can be execution.\nyusheng kuo: Because it's becoming the agent's prompt to actually do things.\nyusheng kuo: Not just like hey, you should follow this, but you'll actually do this like a campaign analyst for you.\nyusheng kuo: I have a quick sample.\nyusheng kuo: I have this kind of product analysis.\nyusheng kuo: So every morning the agent will send me this report.\nyusheng kuo: Say like a user activity report.\nyusheng kuo: Every morning this report might look slightly different because he will go ahead and search what's interesting thing to improve.\nyusheng kuo: Like who I should contact, like using the product recently, but not like I have have some kind of a issue or whatever or like where there's any kind of a limitation recently that I should notice.\nyusheng kuo: So every morning he kind of come back with me of this and I can actually just like mail back.\nyusheng kuo: So it's like the same thing.\nyusheng kuo: I describe how we want to do analysis.\nyusheng kuo: Analysis for our other team member will also be the same thing for the agent to do and the agent will actually execute it.\nyusheng kuo: So he would just send out this report for me every morning.\nyusheng kuo: And the way that actually he can send out this report any morning, every morning at AAN is because the deployment platform we have, so if you can see, it's like we have this kind of agent platform.\nyusheng kuo: So it's a daily activity report.\nyusheng kuo: So I set it up.\nyusheng kuo: We have this schedule like say every.\nyusheng kuo: It's a crown job, a scheduled job every day aan.\nyusheng kuo: You should go ahead and using this agent and then send me the report.\nyusheng kuo: And then you can see it's basically just reading your GitHub repository and then parse the agents like Cloud Agent MD.\nyusheng kuo: So whatever the agent you have here you can see if I can just refresh.\nyusheng kuo: You will just pull the latest agent file you have and I will just one click like here I just one click it.\nyusheng kuo: Become an agent with a webhook with it.\nyusheng kuo: So you can send this agent data through this webhook but don't try to memorize it.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, I will delete this after.\nyusheng kuo: So you know.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And because it's called code, right.\nyusheng kuo: So if you have KAU code ready you can even use, unlike Clay, you can only use your cloud API.\nyusheng kuo: Here is the Kauko under the hood.\nyusheng kuo: So you can use your subscription, like a 200 subscription.\nyusheng kuo: So it doesn't cost you any extra API costs for this, all this different activity which is basically like a spin up a remote cow code for you.\nAndrew Osborne: So what I really want to understand is like I told you last week, I'm really not using the slash agent.\nAndrew Osborne: I use.\nyusheng kuo: Sorry, I think I lost you.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, andrew's still here.\nyusheng kuo: It.\nyusheng kuo: Hello?\nyusheng kuo: No, I, I still couldn't hear you.\nyusheng kuo: Like breaking up.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know if it's me.\nyusheng kuo: Let me try to stop.\nyusheng kuo: Can you hear me?\nyusheng kuo: Andrew?\nyusheng kuo: Oh, hello.\nyusheng kuo: Hello, can you hear me?\nAndrew Osborne: Yes, sorry about that.\nAndrew Osborne: My connection just.\nyusheng kuo: Oh no, no problem.\nyusheng kuo: I know you're outside, so yeah, the connection can be shaky.\nAndrew Osborne: Did you hear what I'll say?\nyusheng kuo: No, I'm at home.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAndrew Osborne: Where did it cut out?\nAndrew Osborne: What was I saying before it cut out?\nyusheng kuo: Oh you say, you say like you say you haven't really started using agent.\nyusheng kuo: Exactly.\nAndrew Osborne: So I use the slash skills quite a lot.\nAndrew Osborne: But I don't really use the slash agents much.\nAndrew Osborne: And my question to you is like where should I be using it?\nAndrew Osborne: Because it seems like you have agents and the agents have skills.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nAndrew Osborne: And then also I hear people talking about they spin up sub agents and this agents do the work in its own context window.\nAndrew Osborne: All of this and that.\nAndrew Osborne: Yeah, I'm trying to understand all of that stuff.\nyusheng kuo: So, so the way I'm thinking it, a skill is a capacity.\nyusheng kuo: Like you can think like you have several skill, right?\nyusheng kuo: You have the skill.\nyusheng kuo: Like, like, like my, my product review agent, right.\nyusheng kuo: He actually have.\nyusheng kuo: I give it two skill.\nyusheng kuo: One skill is to do product analysis.\nyusheng kuo: So I, I gave him like a problem framework to know how to do the product.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So I have like one is product analysis skill, right.\nyusheng kuo: The other is generate report skill.\nyusheng kuo: So this two like this generate report skill can be used by multiple agents and this product analysis agent, product analysis deal can also be used by like different agent.\nyusheng kuo: But they might have a different downstream purpose.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: They might have the product analysis before investor report.\nyusheng kuo: So you might have a different skill for the final output.\nyusheng kuo: If you only use skill to like lump sum everything, then every time you change one thing you have to change all the skill.\nyusheng kuo: But now by composing this way you create this kind of almost kind of your script have dependency of certain like library.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know if you use typescript or use the Python like in Python we have this different library, right?\nyusheng kuo: And I can upgrade my library independent to touch the.\nyusheng kuo: The agent.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Now everyone should do like a report.\nyusheng kuo: This way we change our brain color and you just change one thing in your Skill, every agent will follow.\nyusheng kuo: So just building user agent and skill like a software.\nyusheng kuo: And I, that's why I see the, the way I found it very scalable in my, my personal like use case because I can actually make it very modularized.\nyusheng kuo: Like my skill.\nyusheng kuo: I can optimize my skill independently and then the scale can have the script that can modify like independently.\nyusheng kuo: So that's like, that's like why I feel like agent.\nyusheng kuo: It would be that it should be the eventual way to interact with the human being because they have the whole capability in third by just one functionality.\nAndrew Osborne: Yeah, interesting because I'm just trying to understand because like how I should change things for my use case.\nAndrew Osborne: So that's.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, we can try to brainstorm it.\nyusheng kuo: Like what's, what's your skill?\nyusheng kuo: Let's first try to audit your skill.\nyusheng kuo: Like what, what, what kind of skill you have and how would you like, does it only do one thing or you try to have the skill do multiple things?\nAndrew Osborne: Yeah, so I've, I've got skills, for example, where I might have one.\nAndrew Osborne: I might have this one skill where it takes like the intake and it takes all the files we have from a client, like the intake files form the discovery, like the, the kickoff call of the client where we kind of.\nyusheng kuo: Go back and forth.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAndrew Osborne: And it'll take all of that information.\nAndrew Osborne: It will basically turn it into, it'll create the buying Persona.\nAndrew Osborne: Let me even show you.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nAndrew Osborne: And again, this is all a work in progress.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nAndrew Osborne: And show you the progress that I have so far.\nAndrew Osborne: You see my screen?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's showing up.\nAndrew Osborne: Can you see it now?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, I can see.\nAndrew Osborne: Yeah.\nAndrew Osborne: So for example, I might have one like skill.\nAndrew Osborne: Just say like this skill, for example, where basically all it does is and I let Claude create all of this.\nAndrew Osborne: So I don't know.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nAndrew Osborne: But what it basically does is it takes the intake form.\nAndrew Osborne: So like the intake file or any of the files that we get from the client when they onboard of us and then it will then basically turn that into what does it do in the end?\nAndrew Osborne: I think it creates different markdown files for like the ICP profile of that client and the Persona and like the research of the Persona.\nAndrew Osborne: So on the kickoff call they tell us, okay, we sell this product and we sell it to, I don't know, funded series A through C tech companies in the US and we like to sell to companies that use HubSpot because we have a HubSpot integration service or whatever.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nAndrew Osborne: So all of that is in the kickoff call and in the intake form.\nAndrew Osborne: And I'm basically using that skill to make these like two different markdown files which contain all this information.\nAndrew Osborne: And then I've got other skills here.\nAndrew Osborne: So this one skill, basically it connects to Instantly's MCP and it will basically pull all of the campaigns related to that client and it'll basically show me like the based off of my preferences it will say okay, here's the reply rate.\nAndrew Osborne: All the people that are responding badly, they're saying this thing.\nAndrew Osborne: So they might be saying, oh, we already have something in place.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nAndrew Osborne: And all of that is good information that we can then use.\nAndrew Osborne: So yeah, that's what this skill does.\nAndrew Osborne: Yeah, like this skill for example, basically what it does is it kind of tries to suggest ways that we can find companies that need our service beyond just looking at basic like thermographic.\nAndrew Osborne: So most companies say okay, we sell to.\nAndrew Osborne: So most companies, they have an ICP.\nAndrew Osborne: So yeah, he's in the US 50 to 200 headcount.\nAndrew Osborne: But what I'm doing here is I'm basically trying to create like ics which is like a idle client situation.\nAndrew Osborne: So what I mean by that is maybe they, they don't have any rev ops on their team or maybe they are, they're hiring.\nAndrew Osborne: So all this skill does is it basically like uses a bunch of information to try and come up with different like situations that could be relevant based on that client.\nAndrew Osborne: So the whole point is that all of these skills are all things that I do manually for each client.\nAndrew Osborne: So I just want, I'm just trying to turn it into skills so whenever we onboard a new client it can just go and do all of this work for me.\nAndrew Osborne: Does that make sense right now?\nyusheng kuo: Totally, totally.\nAndrew Osborne: All skills.\nAndrew Osborne: So I talk to it all through Claude.\nAndrew Osborne: None of them are agents.\nAndrew Osborne: So what I'm trying to ask you is where should I be making an agent?\nAndrew Osborne: Yeah, yeah, basically that's the first question.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I think the first thing I can think of is you can create the so called like onboard agent, right?\nyusheng kuo: So this agent will actually use your kick up generator skill to kind of create a summary skill.\nyusheng kuo: That would be the step one.\nyusheng kuo: And then the second skill is called like situation mining strategies.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So like this second skill will actually read the the result.\nyusheng kuo: You can actually train them, right.\nyusheng kuo: Say okay, like how do I, where do I get this like thermographic data or like, like understanding.\nyusheng kuo: Because your, your situation mining strategy doesn't create icp.\nyusheng kuo: Like it doesn't create a transcript or like a client summary, right?\nAndrew Osborne: No.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So he can Actually go to.\nyusheng kuo: Because if you write out the intake processor to your local file, then the other skill can actually pick it up to read it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's how my skill created.\nyusheng kuo: I first download the transcript, right.\nyusheng kuo: And then the other skill like meeting summary skill will actually pick up the result.\nyusheng kuo: So that would be like you first have an agent called like onboard agent or like kickoff agent.\nyusheng kuo: So it can go end to end from like download the transcript, understanding the situation, maybe ask you some question along the way.\nyusheng kuo: You can use the ask user question tool.\nyusheng kuo: That's a very powerful tool to let you ask quick question to make sure you align along the way.\nyusheng kuo: And you can have the final report generation agent to create a final report in the way that you want.\nyusheng kuo: So you independently create a different format of a report that should be more universal.\nyusheng kuo: Like using probably your brand collar, you can even directly have a proposal RFP skill.\nyusheng kuo: In the end, you have an rfp, okay, this client, he has this kind of a situation.\nyusheng kuo: And then after the onboard meeting we have and then after we do the situation skill understanding of this one, what's our proposal?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, or you can even have like clay strategies agent.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: End to end.\nyusheng kuo: I just basically have this agent like once they finish onboard transcript, you already get everything in the result.\nyusheng kuo: Instead of like having like only like one, like you have to like manually type in like one by one and then, and then try to tune in.\nyusheng kuo: That's how I would try to describe how this agent can use this skill.\nyusheng kuo: Because I think your skill is really a skill level.\nyusheng kuo: They are very.\nyusheng kuo: Doing a very specific thing.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAndrew Osborne: So.\nAndrew Osborne: So where do you think I need to create an agency?\nyusheng kuo: Like for example, like the.\nyusheng kuo: The whole kickoff Kickoff agent.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: You have the skill of your kickoff.\nyusheng kuo: What's it called?\nyusheng kuo: Like intake processor skill.\nyusheng kuo: And after the intake processor skill skill, your next skill for the agent will be the situation mining strategies.\nyusheng kuo: And then you might have one another instantly analysis.\nyusheng kuo: I'm not sure if instantly analysis skill will be useful here, but you can say like, okay, this type of.\nyusheng kuo: But there's another one is like how this client compare to our historical client so we know some of their behavior.\nyusheng kuo: You can have that.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know if you store that in there instantly.\nyusheng kuo: So you know this type of a client how their reply rate already look like historically.\nyusheng kuo: So that's can you can call it like probably not exactly the instantaneous skill, but you can use that skill to help you to know how to pull the data and then have a final like a report generator skill to generate a report.\nyusheng kuo: So your team can kind of review.\nyusheng kuo: So one call after the call, if you deploy, especially if you deploy the agent on us, then you don't even need to like get up like every client, everyone, every team member after their kickoff meeting.\nyusheng kuo: Because probably not just you doing this kickoff meeting, right?\nyusheng kuo: Once you've been deployed, like everyone will just use the same agent.\nyusheng kuo: So everyone finish their report, they will have the report like available to your notion data or like whatever you manage your data room.\nyusheng kuo: Everyone's report will all be there for your boss, whoever to review.\nyusheng kuo: So that can have a very clear picture of what's going on.\nAndrew Osborne: Okay, so, so, so you think I just need one agent to do this whole process?\nAndrew Osborne: That's what I'm trying to understand.\nAndrew Osborne: Or do I need multiple agents?\nyusheng kuo: No, no, you just need one agent to do that.\nyusheng kuo: You need one agent to.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAndrew Osborne: What would the task of that agent be?\nyusheng kuo: So the task of the agent would just be like, basically like think of this like a RFP agent, right?\nyusheng kuo: You to, to be able to create this proposal.\nyusheng kuo: You need every aspect of this client.\nyusheng kuo: So what?\nyusheng kuo: Why?\nyusheng kuo: What?\nyusheng kuo: Okay, maybe I can ask you what do you typically do after your entire processor?\nyusheng kuo: What do you do after that?\nAndrew Osborne: Yes, I've got all these skills are the steps that I do.\nAndrew Osborne: So we process the call.\nAndrew Osborne: So and like what happens manually is we take the kickoff called the client.\nAndrew Osborne: Then I sit there, I look at the kickoff call transcripts, I look at the intake form and from that I begin to think to myself, okay, like how am I going to go about, like what companies are we, what companies are we going to go after?\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nAndrew Osborne: So what list do I need to build?\nAndrew Osborne: Like what tools am I going to going to use?\nAndrew Osborne: So I might say to myself, okay, cool, this is a salesforce consultancy and they sell to funded tech companies that ideally they don't have anyone on their in Rev Ops, for example, right?\nAndrew Osborne: So they don't have anyone that's owning that, that, that position.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nAndrew Osborne: So and then I might think to myself, okay, first of all, I might look at understanding the pain points of those people.\nAndrew Osborne: I like to go backwards so I might understand, okay, based on what they said on the call, what are the pain points of this ICP and how do we alleviate that pain point?\nAndrew Osborne: Are there any particular list that I can build which will talk to a particular pain point?\nAndrew Osborne: So if I build a list around companies that have no, you know, rev Ops in their team and there's particular, you know, angles I can use in my messaging and once I've done that, then I go on to Say okay or how am I going to build the list to get all those people with those pain points?\nAndrew Osborne: So then I might think around okay, you know, okay, well I mean I'm going to use clay to do this and maybe this tool to do that.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nAndrew Osborne: So that's kind of my process.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So I would say like second part is part of your situation mining strategies skill.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nAndrew Osborne: Which second part?\nyusheng kuo: Sorry, the part you say like okay, after you read the transcript, the intake point, everything you start to kind of try to strategize with this would be your situation mining strategies.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nAndrew Osborne: I mean it all comes under that strategy process.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So that's why I feel this actually you can think of just agent as you.\nyusheng kuo: What do you typically do like end to end and then where do you think should be the failure point?\nyusheng kuo: That's commonly you need to step in, make it as breakpoint of your agent.\nyusheng kuo: But whatever you think, but even this breakpoint can you actually qualify it?\nyusheng kuo: So you don't even need to come in so you can review the agent's result.\nyusheng kuo: For example, can you describe the process you to learn or discern whether this agent should be focusing on like people don't have a graph up.\nyusheng kuo: You can provide some kind of example for it and like a historical how you match it then and that becomes your strategies mining strategies like like input.\nyusheng kuo: So you actually can just create an agent just like what you did actually end to end like from they would read the intact form, they will read the transcript, they will read how to analyze this agent.\nyusheng kuo: That how you should analyze this customer.\nyusheng kuo: And eventually they can even learn how to actually you can even create a skill is like a implementation skill.\nyusheng kuo: Right for in the clay.\nyusheng kuo: What this would possibly be done in clay actually agent is pretty good at that.\nyusheng kuo: So by the end you already have everything.\nyusheng kuo: Your agent output is actually like okay, this agent, this incoming customer, this is their characteristic.\nyusheng kuo: That's what we believe that who we should target it to.\nyusheng kuo: And the reason of that is what.\nyusheng kuo: And then we can use certain tool that we have in our task stack to do that.\nyusheng kuo: So you already have that and then you only need to kind of review that.\nyusheng kuo: You can say okay, this part is not right.\nyusheng kuo: Like you should try to improve that.\nyusheng kuo: This very important is like if you try to qualify everything, if you see something that's not right, you can actually update your prompt and next time let's call the compounding right next time actually you can start to gradually instill yourself into the agent process so it become more and more aligned.\nyusheng kuo: So the ideal condition would Be like really in the end you just can replicate Your app to 10 different clients.\nyusheng kuo: They are all almost like as good as you.\nyusheng kuo: Or you only need to do very minimal change like you don't have, you don't need to step into each different like clients, client call, client phone.\nyusheng kuo: And then redo this kind of strategizing thinking again.\nyusheng kuo: You can try to qualify it and then structuralize that.\nyusheng kuo: And then every time you kind of give feedback to your agent, the agent codified that understanding into his prompt.\nyusheng kuo: But that, that, that's where the compound is kind of coming from.\nyusheng kuo: Like I, I'm kind of trying to do this thing too.\nyusheng kuo: Like how can I continue to say okay, this kind of analysis of product is not enough.\nyusheng kuo: You should do this as well.\nyusheng kuo: And then after I finish that actually I would say okay, update.\nyusheng kuo: It's called like I have a skill called like a reflection.\nyusheng kuo: It would just reflect that into my prompt.\nyusheng kuo: So there's a two factor is improving.\nyusheng kuo: Your prom is improving.\nyusheng kuo: Also underlying agents performance will also be improving because the model would continue to improve.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So how do you build this infrastructure so you can better describe what you want continuously, effortlessly while also leverage the model's improvement.\nyusheng kuo: So that's where I feel the agents the position should be like try to replicate you.\nAndrew Osborne: Interesting.\nAndrew Osborne: Interesting.\nAndrew Osborne: Well I want to start things small which is why I'm asking what's the first low hanging fruit that I can focus on?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I would say we.\nyusheng kuo: I, I think the first low hanging.\nyusheng kuo: I, I fully agree, fully agree with you.\nyusheng kuo: I think the first low hanging fruit I can think of is after the NCAT form.\nyusheng kuo: Let agent do the strategization right after using the the mining strategies skill.\nyusheng kuo: So it's like a very small loop.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: You basically let agent read the inform, read the intact and see what the strategy they come up with.\nyusheng kuo: So you don't just have the intake form result of your scale, you have a strategy already presented to you.\nyusheng kuo: And then you can start with that to like a tightly loop like okay, this is not a good strategy because this doesn't make sense.\nyusheng kuo: And every time try to say okay, try to understand why I don't like this.\nyusheng kuo: Qualify it into your prompt.\nyusheng kuo: So that's very tight loop.\nyusheng kuo: And then there's only two skill there.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Just one is like whatever you already have.\nyusheng kuo: One is intake form.\nyusheng kuo: One is intake like a skill.\nyusheng kuo: The other is just the strategy, the mining strategy skill just have these two.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAndrew Osborne: And, and to create an agent what I've got to do is just do the slash agent.\nAndrew Osborne: That's agent Right.\nAndrew Osborne: Okay, cool.\nAndrew Osborne: I'll give that a try.\nAndrew Osborne: I guess I'll.\nAndrew Osborne: I'll do that first because I guess I need to create an agent there to be able to host it on your tool.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Just.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, don't worry about us.\nyusheng kuo: Like, try to see how you can actually leverage agent and then build the agent this way.\nyusheng kuo: Give you this kind of modularization, like a software.\nyusheng kuo: I think you have the software background so you understand this kind of importance of try to modularize things so you don't repeat yourself.\nAndrew Osborne: I'll do that.\nAndrew Osborne: Then once I've done that, we can probably reconnect and see how I can host on your platform.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I mean it will be even better if you have NAN because NAN actually have a lot of different trigger.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: They can have a different trigger, actually.\nyusheng kuo: Basically our webhook become a node like you can put into your HTTP node in the end.\nyusheng kuo: So you can use Telegram to trigger our agent, your agent.\nyusheng kuo: So you don't need to go to cloud code to trigger that.\nyusheng kuo: Any team member can use the slack to trigger that.\nAndrew Osborne: Yeah.\nAndrew Osborne: Nice.\nAndrew Osborne: Amazing.\nAndrew Osborne: Yeah, I need to hop off now because.\nyusheng kuo: Yes, thank you.\nyusheng kuo: But we'll have to take.\nAndrew Osborne: We'll have to have another conversation maybe after I get this agent stuff set up and I'm in a better position to do some more stuff with you guys on your platform and we'll have a chat then.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, Just one final words.\nyusheng kuo: When you create agent, there's a certain process I think it's very useful to me because when you create agent inside this slash agent, create agent thing, it doesn't have the full context of all your tool or your files.\nyusheng kuo: He would kind of just go to the model and then say, hey, this guy want to do this agent.\nyusheng kuo: It doesn't do the whole reading.\nyusheng kuo: So do this slash agent is kind of a registered agent.\nyusheng kuo: Then go out and say, okay, I want to do this and try to use this agent and then see where it break and say, okay, this is not what I want.\nyusheng kuo: Improve it just like how you would improve the skill like that.\nyusheng kuo: So try to test it locally.\nyusheng kuo: See?\nyusheng kuo: Okay, try to say one way is like clear, clear slash, clear by no context.\nyusheng kuo: And try to say, okay, I want to do this.\nyusheng kuo: This is your info.\nyusheng kuo: Use this agent and see how well it does.\nyusheng kuo: And most likely it probably will fail.\nAndrew Osborne: Do you have any like anything you can share?\nAndrew Osborne: Like any document, any blogs or anything you can share about that?\nyusheng kuo: I will write it up.\nyusheng kuo: I plan to write it up because I see people like it kind of creating agent and then they kind of not, because that's the problem of Calco.\nyusheng kuo: Like they didn't really have a really good agent creation.\nyusheng kuo: Like they're slash agent.\nyusheng kuo: Like auto creation is not, not, not, not quite optimized.\nyusheng kuo: So, okay, I, I will give you, I, I'll post the link in post and you can refer out there.\nAndrew Osborne: Yeah, just, please just send me some information about that because I, I, I can't remember that.\nAndrew Osborne: So if you could just write something down for me.\nAndrew Osborne: Yeah, I can use it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, definitely.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Cool.\nAndrew Osborne: Thank you very much.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, thank you, Andrew.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, talk to you soon.\nyusheng kuo: Good seeing.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nTitle: 30 Min Meeting between Yusheng Kuo and Andrew Osborne\nHost Email: yusheng.kuo@datagen.dev\nOrganizer Email: yusheng.kuo@datagen.dev\nCalendar Id:
