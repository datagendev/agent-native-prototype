shot.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, I mean I, I read their message and I think we will quickly go ahead and get started.\nyusheng kuo: What do you think?\nyusheng kuo: Or you want some intro?\nAriel Levin: So I mean, I'm just, just curious, you know, why you're offering this.\nAriel Levin: How can I help you, you know, move forward?\nAriel Levin: Let me just drop my note taker there.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, sure.\nyusheng kuo: So, yeah, a bit of ourselves.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know if you visited our website.\nyusheng kuo: So basically, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: May I know what's your understanding like.\nyusheng kuo: Just by visiting our website?\nAriel Levin: So it's like infrastructure for agents, a place to run.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, cool.\nyusheng kuo: At least we get that, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So it's like a platform to deploy agents.\nyusheng kuo: But I think this agent is different from a typical deployment platform and it's really designed for cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: So if you try to create an agent in cloud code, you might notice.\nyusheng kuo: That it's actually surprisingly simple to create agent.\nyusheng kuo: It's like you don't need to write complicated code like a lane chain and try to chain in together or castrate.\nyusheng kuo: You just prompt it.\nyusheng kuo: But it's so powerful because it's using cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: It's just like open cloud.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know if you follow that hype.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's like the same LLM like a looping with the harness just make them very powerful agent framework.\nyusheng kuo: And then I feel in the very near future.\nyusheng kuo: So there's a two things that get so powerful.\nyusheng kuo: It's like one is of course.\nyusheng kuo: Your prompts like a guidance.\nyusheng kuo: But what makes them so powerful is that they have a good LLM and they have good harness to know how to loop and imagine their own context.\nyusheng kuo: And then also they are living in basically operating system.\nyusheng kuo: They are not just like sting API layer and I have to go ahead and pull all the tool.\nyusheng kuo: They have direct access to the file system so they can write their contacts into the file and they can lay down review.\nyusheng kuo: Instead of like oh, a user have to manage their own contacts and then once they compact they lose the lose the previous memory.\nyusheng kuo: So all of this I feel, my belief is although we are targeting on KAU today, sooner or later all of the coding agent will become the agent.\nyusheng kuo: Like all the agent will look like a coding agent.\nyusheng kuo: Just like open cloud is basically a PI agent.\nyusheng kuo: It's like open source cloud code alternative and that become the personal assistant agent.\nyusheng kuo: And I believe in the near future legal provider, accounting provider, marketing provider will craft their agent through this context.\nyusheng kuo: Instead of like before they say oh, you have to create this kind of fancy workflow to Create this verticalized agent I believe is like now the domain knowledge owner have two really important job.\nyusheng kuo: One is like provide good tool.\nyusheng kuo: Like you provide certain API, right.\nyusheng kuo: Like a WordPress API.\nyusheng kuo: Like some certain API, maybe some others don't have that kind of access.\nyusheng kuo: So if I hire you actually I.\nyusheng kuo: Can hire you through your agent and.\nyusheng kuo: Your agent which is like running through it.\nyusheng kuo: So that actually created a whole new different economy in my opinion.\nyusheng kuo: Because now you have a bandwidth.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: It's just like in TikTok you have only one per you only there's a 66 billion times 24 hours of the watch time even like everyone's watching TikTok.\nyusheng kuo: But your service similar way.\nyusheng kuo: But if you have an agent you can simultaneously provide like a 10 year or so to this kind of agent and you as a verifier will be able to verify in a much more efficient way of the agent output.\nyusheng kuo: So we are seeing this huge agent.\nyusheng kuo: We believe there's a huge agent economy.\nyusheng kuo: Once you be able you as a.\nyusheng kuo: Very strong marketing expert you can encode.\nyusheng kuo: Your understanding into this agent through the contacts through the tool.\nyusheng kuo: And people later on don't need to hire you directly.\nyusheng kuo: They hire you as an auditor or reviewer.\nyusheng kuo: But the execution is your agent.\nyusheng kuo: Your agent like pulling up everything and you just kind of review and approve.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, that's why we want to try to first understand the reason that we do this kind of 30 minute is we try to understand what people want for the agent and then potentially show them how to do that.\nyusheng kuo: And then if they do feel the need of this agent, don't just run in their terminal like whenever they trigger that they might actually want to use us because then their agent will run 247 like it's a deployed agent.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So that's where, where we are.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: What about you?\nyusheng kuo: Like what do you want?\nyusheng kuo: Like what's your view on this and.\nyusheng kuo: How do you see these things going.\nyusheng kuo: On and transform or like leverage.\nyusheng kuo: You can leverage that for your business.\nAriel Levin: Yeah.\nAriel Levin: So I'm very excited.\nAriel Levin: I mean, I mean I love creating content but and I'd love to.\nAriel Levin: So I see lots of.\nAriel Levin: I see for my own business it's just like creating content, ongoing content, high quality content.\nAriel Levin: So that's one use case the for and generally I think you know we can have, we can create like.\nyusheng kuo: Content.\nAriel Levin: Agency or marketing agency in a box which is essentially an agent.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAriel Levin: That goes.\nAriel Levin: And you know the, the business owner is on the field and it gets, it gets sent via WhatsApp or Telegram or Post and he has to approve it or give some feedback and that's it, it's done.\nAriel Levin: It gets up in the morning.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAriel Levin: So yeah so but I think that's, I, I come from a marketing sales sort of background and this is what I do right now.\nAriel Levin: But I think there's a whole, you know, business OS that can run like that.\nAriel Levin: So business starts, they get everything through some sort of an interface, their daily, whatever they need to do their posts, they need to approve anything that they need to know, you know.\nAriel Levin: So yeah, so some, something like a combination of a virtual assistant meets marketing agent.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nAriel Levin: Some sort of appointment center.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I, I, I, I fully agree with you.\nyusheng kuo: Like the other day I wanted because I need to create some contract for the client, potential client and then even I have cow code.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know if that contract is good.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like I need a contract expert, like.\nyusheng kuo: A legal aspect to proofread it and.\nyusheng kuo: Like a good agent who have good understanding what this good contract should look like.\nyusheng kuo: What are the checkpoint?\nyusheng kuo: What are the guardrail?\nyusheng kuo: Actually that should all be like embedded to their agent.\nyusheng kuo: So like I don't believe people say like AI output is slop.\nyusheng kuo: It's AI output slop.\nyusheng kuo: If it's a normal people who have no understanding or inside of that field creating something without a good verifier that, that would be the slot.\nyusheng kuo: But like you say like so that's where I see it actually like you, I really agree with you.\nyusheng kuo: You agent wouldn't be commoditized because of the context you actually embedded into your agent.\nyusheng kuo: So let's get started.\nyusheng kuo: I would try to cover as much as possible and feel free to stop me and we can, I think we really align and I'm open to the partnership.\nyusheng kuo: Like we can provide a technical side of it and you can provide the business side of it.\nyusheng kuo: Like and then, and then what?\nyusheng kuo: Through our experience actually there's very important like you are the main prompter and main verifier and that's like day and night of the good outcome and bad outcome.\nyusheng kuo: Like we are like a real.\nyusheng kuo: But you, you are like the, the real like a beautiful car that's like running on top of it.\nyusheng kuo: So let me go ahead and start.\nyusheng kuo: To share my screen.\nyusheng kuo: So I review.\nyusheng kuo: Let me know when you can see my screen.\nyusheng kuo: I think my Google Meet is a bit bugg so sometimes it will just drop in the middle of the conversation.\nyusheng kuo: So feel free to stop me if.\nyusheng kuo: You see that get dropped.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, let me know if you can see my screen now.\nAriel Levin: Yeah, I can See your screen?\nAriel Levin: Absolutely.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so first I want to quickly emphasize like a difference between like agent OS and agent assisted software.\nyusheng kuo: So what we want to build is agent os.\nyusheng kuo: So what's the differences?\nyusheng kuo: Like agent is the core.\nyusheng kuo: Even sometimes there's like people like doing like a workflow.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: I would consider that as an agent assisted software.\nyusheng kuo: They are not really agent os.\nyusheng kuo: So there are a few distinction.\nyusheng kuo: Like we don't want to build software.\nyusheng kuo: We want to build like agent.\nyusheng kuo: And like how do you know if it's an agent?\nyusheng kuo: Like asset Core is like does each request actually require agent like output?\nyusheng kuo: Like if you build a workflow, build a dashboard, like not everything like required your agent output and then we will still build the tool later on you'll see we'll still build a tool but it's a different like a monolithic code.\nyusheng kuo: Like basically, oh, I create a marketing agent and then people will send some.\nyusheng kuo: Kind of a fixed schema to me.\nyusheng kuo: And then I would just crunching through it and then get an output of it and it's a fixed output.\nyusheng kuo: So that's not what we are building.\nyusheng kuo: We actually are using code as like a tool.\nyusheng kuo: The agent can decide when to use it and it can even modify it.\nyusheng kuo: And then it should be very small and lightweight.\nyusheng kuo: The real thing, the real meat is not the code, it's actually the context.\nyusheng kuo: So you need to spend a lot.\nyusheng kuo: Of time to craft your contacts where.\nyusheng kuo: To source this context, how do you store this context, how do you structure your files folder so this contact is easy for the agent to be fetched and doesn't waste too much of the context token.\nyusheng kuo: So that's important.\nyusheng kuo: The whole context, both the content and.\nyusheng kuo: Scaffolding is important as a code.\nyusheng kuo: And then because of that, if we have a good context, we'd be able to encode our knowledge easily into this context.\nyusheng kuo: And I will later on show how.\nyusheng kuo: I believe it's the best way to embed this terminology through by showing agent what to do and then let it summarize it.\nyusheng kuo: So it's like in contrast, like if we view like for example like, like a lane train workflow, like doing like a research first, data extraction first, then and then do some analyzer or something.\nyusheng kuo: It's actually going to be even, even like every step have some kind of AI like, like AI API call.\nyusheng kuo: The whole thing is still very fragile.\nyusheng kuo: If there's anything like broken.\nyusheng kuo: I will give you a very quick example.\nyusheng kuo: So like using that is actually the turnout of the.\nyusheng kuo: The result will be very fragile.\nyusheng kuo: And then, but if you're using the Asian horse is a very adaptive screen by the way.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, sorry.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I want to give you a very vivid example.\nyusheng kuo: So here, this is my daily product review.\nyusheng kuo: So this actually I created agent who will basically pull the data and basically do the deep dive for me.\nyusheng kuo: Like what's the.\nyusheng kuo: Our recent like metrics and who's our power user.\nyusheng kuo: Can you see it?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then he will decide how to analyze the product, understand the product and then send me this, create this report and give it to me.\nyusheng kuo: And every day it might not be the same.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Today it's actually showing more of this active user thing.\nyusheng kuo: The trend what actually is dropping.\nyusheng kuo: What's the issue of it?\nyusheng kuo: And here is like a very interesting example.\nyusheng kuo: Like this is like an ideal outcome, right.\nyusheng kuo: But the other day actually.\nyusheng kuo: This one.\nyusheng kuo: He has some issue of my Neon because our Neon is not responsive for some reason.\nyusheng kuo: So for the traditional software, right.\nyusheng kuo: Even you do this kind of workflow of an agent chain.\nyusheng kuo: This is broken the whole thing, the email just wouldn't send out.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: He will just get an error message maybe from Century or some monitor.\nyusheng kuo: But here, because we are using agent, he knows like, okay, Neon is not working, but the rest of the stuff is still working.\nyusheng kuo: I can still adapt my, my report according to the message I have.\nyusheng kuo: The, the data I have, I can still send to me.\nyusheng kuo: And then I will still notify you that I have some issue.\nyusheng kuo: So you should go ahead and fix it.\nyusheng kuo: Or like I can actually respond to.\nyusheng kuo: It to, to fix it.\nyusheng kuo: But that's how I mean like an agent is like much more adapted, more adaptive than.\nyusheng kuo: Than the traditional software.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then that actually give us a lot of benefit.\nyusheng kuo: So let me go back to it.\nyusheng kuo: So here are the six way.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, sorry.\nyusheng kuo: So because I saw your request, I do want to emphasize a bit on.\nyusheng kuo: The agent and skills.\nyusheng kuo: So like I still have your message.\nyusheng kuo: So you mentioned that first you want to have this kind of content research agent, extract agent, review agent and so.\nyusheng kuo: On and so forth.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: I will actually try to separate them as one is like agent, which is like affiliation agent.\nyusheng kuo: Here's an example.\nyusheng kuo: So I believe the agent is actually construct the whole job like end to end.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Take.\nyusheng kuo: Take this one example.\nyusheng kuo: I have three skill.\nyusheng kuo: One is like a active data analysis skill to know how to do my product analysis.\nyusheng kuo: Like you use like.\nyusheng kuo: And then within that skill he would use MCP like a Neon MCP and post hoc MCP and then some linking MCP to like corporate that.\nyusheng kuo: And then you also have another skill called report skill.\nyusheng kuo: So Their report skill will based on incoming, incoming data that's available to dynamically generate a report.\nyusheng kuo: And then finally there's a send email.\nyusheng kuo: So he knows who to send, how to send email.\nyusheng kuo: So.\nyusheng kuo: Sorry, disagree.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so I briefly like basically using your example, right?\nyusheng kuo: So your, your agent, I would call it like affiliate content pipeline agent.\nyusheng kuo: So that's like daily weekly newsletter of the affiliation content and how to do the content.\nyusheng kuo: I. I still don't fully know what would be the end outcome is.\nyusheng kuo: I would need your help to verify it.\nyusheng kuo: But that's how I would say, okay, your agent should be the one actually doing the final end to end job.\nyusheng kuo: The agent would be specific to a.\nyusheng kuo: Job to be done.\nyusheng kuo: But the skill is reusable capability.\nyusheng kuo: For example, the research one is actually reusable.\nyusheng kuo: You might actually have a different agent that will also use this research collector or use this content creator.\nyusheng kuo: You might actually run a blog post like pipeline who use the content creator and might use the research collector.\nyusheng kuo: But they're serving a different purpose or serving a different job.\nyusheng kuo: So that's how I would separate the like some taxonomy about where should I.\nyusheng kuo: Think it should be considered as an agent?\nyusheng kuo: Where should I think consider as a skill?\nyusheng kuo: Does that make sense?\nAriel Levin: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So, so you, you're familiar with skill, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then like within the skill there are typically a certain tool, right?\nyusheng kuo: Like here the research one will have.\nyusheng kuo: The tool and the tool can both.\nyusheng kuo: Be script, the coded script or MCP tool.\nyusheng kuo: And there should be some kind of.\nyusheng kuo: Context file so the skill can know how to do it.\nyusheng kuo: And then like for example, research collector, I think you mentioned like a breadth search API.\nyusheng kuo: I use actual SERP API to do that.\nyusheng kuo: The target platform.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So that's how, how the skill would be done.\nyusheng kuo: Like so skill content tool and then context file to make it a good skill.\nyusheng kuo: Now let's come to how do I create agent?\nyusheng kuo: So the most useful way for me to create like a really good agent is not by prompting.\nyusheng kuo: Do I lose you?\nyusheng kuo: No.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So like I believe that the develop by doing, not by prompting is because when we are prompting it's very easy.\nyusheng kuo: We miss something and then there are some edge cases that we don't cover.\nyusheng kuo: But by doing that, it's like you show your kids how to do things.\nyusheng kuo: It's much easier to describe to him.\nyusheng kuo: How to do things.\nyusheng kuo: And by showing that actually you create a chase of what you've done and, and then later on model can just follow this action trace and then you ask it to okay, summarize what we've done and then update this agent file as the agent prompt file.\nyusheng kuo: So they know what tool you call, they know what's actually you don't like.\nyusheng kuo: They know your preference and they will be able to like auto generate the agent that for you.\nyusheng kuo: So that's much easier.\nyusheng kuo: The third thing is like happily a lot I don't know if you use MCP or if you use API mostly.\nAriel Levin: Yeah, I use.\nAriel Levin: I use both MCP and API.\nAriel Levin: I mean I use HubSpot MCP and I use another tool called Explorium which is a data provider.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, it's from Israel is right.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So a lot of time when you call the mcp the MCP tool result would directly return to your context window.\nyusheng kuo: Then say I pull the linking post, the 10 linking posts.\nyusheng kuo: If I use MCP tool directly, the whole 10 linking post will directly be returned to my context window and then.\nyusheng kuo: Quickly I occupy it.\nyusheng kuo: But what you need to do instead.\nyusheng kuo: Is try to write small script to.\nyusheng kuo: Save the tool result into a temp file.\nyusheng kuo: They serve two very useful things.\nyusheng kuo: One is now your model wouldn't directly get blown up by this tool return.\nyusheng kuo: Then secondly, and then they can review that later, they can actually read the file instead of it directly.\nyusheng kuo: That's called recursive language model.\nyusheng kuo: They basically save the result into a file and then they read the file later on.\nyusheng kuo: Then they can using their tool to effectively read it.\nyusheng kuo: The second thing is that become persistent.\nyusheng kuo: Even you go further to your discussion with the agent.\nyusheng kuo: You can still let agent look back and then it's lossless because you have saved all the tool results with.\nyusheng kuo: So instead of relying on the agent to review his own context before this is much more reliable.\nyusheng kuo: Doing that and try to save all your context as part of the chase is important.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And sometimes if you need you, you need to validate with the hook.\nyusheng kuo: So basically it's a way for agent to know like for example, if you want your newsletter have a certain structure output and if it doesn't fit into the output they should raise.\nyusheng kuo: You can use the hook to kind of validate that.\nAriel Levin: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So that.\nyusheng kuo: Sorry, was it?\nAriel Levin: Oh, you might.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, now I want to start to develop with you.\nyusheng kuo: I prepare something already.\nyusheng kuo: Here's what I've done if you can see it.\nyusheng kuo: So first.\nyusheng kuo: I create this research research collector skill.\nyusheng kuo: And then first of the first question is like I think you're saying like when you say GTM platform you're like a GTM vendor or you're talking about like some kind of a Community.\nAriel Levin: Sorry, what was I saying about gtm?\nyusheng kuo: So you mentioned like you want to research the GTM platform, right?\nyusheng kuo: What do you mean the platform here?\nAriel Levin: Oh, like LinkedIn.\nAriel Levin: Like what we use is we connect if it for the newsletter.\nAriel Levin: What I do is I scrape a tool like episode to scrape LinkedIn posts from specific people and extract this data and make it into a newsletter somehow.\nAriel Levin: Maybe make it unique or maybe quote them.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I see.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, we can, we can further like extend that.\nyusheng kuo: But you can see that's how I actually structure my research collector.\nyusheng kuo: So here my research collector is like I try to.\nyusheng kuo: Here's something I probably misunderstood is we.\nyusheng kuo: You can give it a name of the company and then he will basically create this content that's including the blog of the content and the case study of the content and YouTube of the content and then try to basically have the index to read all of them.\nyusheng kuo: So that would be able to like, basically you'll be able to.\nyusheng kuo: I, I probably misunderstood that, but I thought it's like you can prepare the affiliation content like a.\nyusheng kuo: Based on clay.\nAriel Levin: No, we're talking about two different things.\nAriel Levin: So the affiliation is.\nAriel Levin: Okay.\nAriel Levin: Is.\nAriel Levin: Yeah.\nAriel Levin: Affiliation is one product and a newsletter is a different product.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, okay, okay.\nyusheng kuo: But for just let me try to pull this.\nyusheng kuo: I try to understand better.\nAriel Levin: I mean, maybe we can pull the LinkedIn messaging and see what I wrote you about.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So I'm saying this one finds I.\nAriel Levin: Am CM platform content.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nAriel Levin: GTA platform is tools like expanding smartly instantly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, okay.\nAriel Levin: All those tools.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAriel Levin: So go to market software essentially.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, okay, okay.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, okay.\nyusheng kuo: I thought this what you want.\nyusheng kuo: So I'm using like clay as example.\nyusheng kuo: So I basically like try to scrap.\nyusheng kuo: Clay's like a blog, case study, YouTube.\nyusheng kuo: And webinar for example.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know how to like scrap webinar yet.\nyusheng kuo: Do you know if there's a way like to scrap the webinar like just on YouTube?\nAriel Levin: Just the ones that they post on YouTube.\nAriel Levin: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nAriel Levin: It's not posted on YouTube.\nAriel Levin: Most, most stuff today is getting posted on YouTube and being like, I, I just did a Webinar now like 10 minutes.\nAriel Levin: Yeah, like 40 minutes ago.\nAriel Levin: And, and we streamed it to YouTube as well.\nAriel Levin: YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, okay, I see.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So we can now try to first.\nyusheng kuo: We basically view the first is research collector.\nyusheng kuo: So you can take a look at.\nyusheng kuo: How this research actor look like.\nyusheng kuo: So have you started to use code yet?\nAriel Levin: Yeah, I mean, I haven't developed.\nAriel Levin: I mean just for very basic stuff.\nAriel Levin: Like research, collecting different APIs, these type of things.\nAriel Levin: Yeah, but I haven't developed anything yet.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, I.\nyusheng kuo: When, when you are developing in alcohol, I would say it's not like a.\nyusheng kuo: Developing a traditional software.\nyusheng kuo: You're like really developing what you are.\nyusheng kuo: Doing but in a structured way.\nyusheng kuo: Let me try to get this one now.\nyusheng kuo: So you can see.\nyusheng kuo: So in the cloud you can see the skill.\nyusheng kuo: And here's a how to create agent skill.\nyusheng kuo: And we have this research collector agent.\nyusheng kuo: So you can see this actually is the research agent.\nyusheng kuo: He will try to run this research.\nyusheng kuo: Collector by platform and the domain.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: This will trigger this skill.\nyusheng kuo: So you just create this skill by just asking cloud to do it.\nyusheng kuo: And then what he does is first he would try to run this content map that's I created like before this meeting.\nyusheng kuo: And of course I use cloud code to develop that.\nyusheng kuo: So you can consider this screen disappeared again.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, sorry.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So here he will save the JSON output.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So first he will try to map the blog post and he will get the blog post and then find the content.\nyusheng kuo: And if there's no blog post he will try the common alternative like a.\nyusheng kuo: Resource, blog article resource, use the first.\nyusheng kuo: One that return result.\nyusheng kuo: And then the step two, he will try to map case study.\nyusheng kuo: Find a case study.\nyusheng kuo: He will try to find a customer, whatever the case study.\nyusheng kuo: He will also use some kind of.\nyusheng kuo: Alternative way and then you will map.\nyusheng kuo: What do you mean?\nAriel Levin: Why do you work in cursor?\nAriel Levin: What does it.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, I typically working.\nyusheng kuo: I typically work in terminal.\nyusheng kuo: I work it here but it's just easier for me to show the files.\nyusheng kuo: It doesn't need to be cursor.\nyusheng kuo: It could be like a PS2 or.\nyusheng kuo: Any kind of file system.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So he will basically create a content and then have a tutorial of the YouTube and then get the YouTube result and eventually they would try to merge.\nyusheng kuo: Everything together to be the content and.\nyusheng kuo: Then he can start to print the summary and then give you the context.\nyusheng kuo: Let's try to run for clay just once.\nyusheng kuo: Let's run for clay.\nyusheng kuo: You can see.\nyusheng kuo: Yes, I do have some small script here, but I'm trying to create a skill that's helping people.\nyusheng kuo: I already tried to write some skills skill here how to create agent to define like.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, how should, how should you create script?\nyusheng kuo: Because like cloud code often tend to.\nyusheng kuo: Like go end to end script.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: But that script is like a very fragile.\nyusheng kuo: Any point it broke, it broke.\nyusheng kuo: But by doing this way like scrap it into like a first like content map.\nyusheng kuo: You just map the Content you have to think in a way that's like you need to give.\nyusheng kuo: The purpose of this script is giving agent the next context.\nyusheng kuo: Like I just need to know.\nyusheng kuo: Because every website might have different map.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So my first step is actually giving the agent the understanding of what's their website map.\nyusheng kuo: So I know where to scrap their.\nyusheng kuo: Blog post or case study.\nyusheng kuo: That's your first tool.\nyusheng kuo: And then once you have this website map like you can use Firecrow to do that.\nyusheng kuo: Then you can give another tool like content block.\nyusheng kuo: You can actually give them this tool.\nyusheng kuo: Where this tool.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that content block URL JSON is actually.\nyusheng kuo: He will try to scrap for that particular content like a URL using another tool and just save the kind of content and that will be actually working.\nyusheng kuo: And Then like for YouTube you use a different tool to do that you use or like a website you use.\nyusheng kuo: Like I use basically like a fire crawl for YouTube.\nyusheng kuo: I wrote, I used the YouTube SDK.\nyusheng kuo: To write a scrapper to do that.\nyusheng kuo: But the hardest part is always the data collection.\nyusheng kuo: Because together this content.\nyusheng kuo: Because some of them are.\nyusheng kuo: You use amplify.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So this is the hardest part.\nyusheng kuo: But once we be able to create this part, I think the rest would.\nyusheng kuo: Be your job to start to show.\nyusheng kuo: How you want to frame it.\nyusheng kuo: That would be our second skill.\nyusheng kuo: So today we can try to just.\nyusheng kuo: Do this to scale.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: He actually tried to say.\nAriel Levin: What's ghosted.\nyusheng kuo: So ghosted is just a better terminal.\nyusheng kuo: For Calca because you use GPU so it doesn't like a flickering.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And so kind of fast.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: We are getting real content.\nyusheng kuo: Sick.\nyusheng kuo: Blog Post 6 you2 already have 17 folder structure.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: I said yes.\nyusheng kuo: So you see like it's like letting agent like creating like this kind of end to end process through the skill.\nyusheng kuo: But using script to help them.\nyusheng kuo: I don't like access the tool they don't have.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: If you do like a deep research on ChatGPT, you wouldn't be able to access YouTube content or some of their blog posts.\nAriel Levin: Okay, your screen's gone again.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: But it's okay because I'm waiting for a result.\nAriel Levin: Okay, sorry.\nyusheng kuo: And then now we need to develop.\nyusheng kuo: Once this is done, we will need.\nyusheng kuo: To develop the next skill.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And the nice thing about using that cursor, you can kind of see the.\nyusheng kuo: Final result here easily.\nyusheng kuo: So we have the skill here and.\nyusheng kuo: Then the content I ask you to.\nyusheng kuo: Save into the agent demo your one.\nyusheng kuo: So you can see here is the way why.\nyusheng kuo: So case study.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Single strategy.\nyusheng kuo: Again.\nyusheng kuo: This is what I Say like, like you just record whatever.\nyusheng kuo: This is more like a real time.\nyusheng kuo: So you see, model doesn't really always align.\nyusheng kuo: And then we need to tell them.\nyusheng kuo: And then later on we'll just summarize, say okay, based on this, what I need update your skill.\nyusheng kuo: So here you come in.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, here's a thing.\nyusheng kuo: You start to populate and then later.\nyusheng kuo: On we don't like we actually let model.\nyusheng kuo: We don't directly fit all of this context into it.\nyusheng kuo: We reference the file and let model to decide how to read it.\nyusheng kuo: Because they would use their way to.\nyusheng kuo: Basically slice the data.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: He's trying to populate everything here.\nyusheng kuo: Because now he's doing the case study hunting.\nyusheng kuo: Hopefully I don't run on my credit.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, it's only six of them.\nyusheng kuo: So I think we're good.\nyusheng kuo: And then you can do be more effective.\nyusheng kuo: Basically you can further like create a task list.\nyusheng kuo: To let it run in parallel.\nyusheng kuo: The first time I would recommend just.\nyusheng kuo: Like let it go so you can kind of see anything is working.\nyusheng kuo: Oh gosh, this is that long.\nyusheng kuo: But this is some transcript here of the YouTube video.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, I think this is good for this.\nyusheng kuo: So here we collect the content.\nyusheng kuo: Now let's go to the second step.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Here's we are.\nyusheng kuo: So that second step I would need your help.\nyusheng kuo: And where are we?\nyusheng kuo: So we build a context layer.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So we have basically the first one and second one done.\nyusheng kuo: Now like okay, what do you think we should do to quality analyze or like to know how we what like you mentioned something like a framework, right?\nyusheng kuo: If I go back to your message, like create an agent, rewrite, adapt with original analysis or like identify key framework data.\nyusheng kuo: How would you describe it?\nyusheng kuo: Let's try to say you just describe what you want.\nyusheng kuo: I would try to show how I would like structure that.\nyusheng kuo: So now we have everything, right?\nyusheng kuo: We have all the content.\nyusheng kuo: If you can see we have the.\nyusheng kuo: Content up here, right?\nyusheng kuo: Like all different.\nyusheng kuo: Whether it's from blog, whether it's case study, whether it's YouTube.\nyusheng kuo: Right now we need to identify their framework.\nyusheng kuo: How should I prompt Heejin to create them?\nyusheng kuo: But before first like okay, update the skill.\nyusheng kuo: So next time we will get content, not just URL.\nyusheng kuo: So see, you'll be able to basically compound your understanding of what a model down and then he will try to update.\nyusheng kuo: But that's the easy task.\nyusheng kuo: Let's try to start to create the next skill.\nyusheng kuo: So by doing that, let's first try to create a good framework.\nyusheng kuo: What a good framework.\nyusheng kuo: Like what a good outcome would look like.\nyusheng kuo: That will Be the first step and then we should push it until we.\nyusheng kuo: See the good outcome of it and.\nyusheng kuo: Then we will be able to summarize.\nyusheng kuo: It as a skill.\nyusheng kuo: So how would you describe it?\nAriel Levin: What number two.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAriel Levin: So we found the content and now we extract it and we wanna like, like we wanna see what the content.\nAriel Levin: I guess we wanna see what the content is about.\nAriel Levin: What people commonly talk about, what sort of are they using tables, are they using text, are they using video, are they using examples, case studies, all those type of things.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, let me try to find.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I should give you my whisper.\nyusheng kuo: Flow, but can you based on the content we extracted.\nyusheng kuo: Like try to extract first would be.\nyusheng kuo: What was that?\nyusheng kuo: Like what people are talking about?\nyusheng kuo: Is that correct?\nyusheng kuo: Is that the right way to describe it?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Text or video of main media.\nyusheng kuo: And like what are the major things in the account?\nAriel Levin: Yeah, sorry.\nyusheng kuo: Anything else?\nyusheng kuo: Like.\nAriel Levin: Sorry, I'm not seeing your screen.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, let me try show you again.\nyusheng kuo: So I say what people are talking about.\nyusheng kuo: Are they using text or video as.\nyusheng kuo: What are the major things in their content?\nyusheng kuo: What, what anything you want to extract.\nyusheng kuo: Like say to, to be able to help you.\nAriel Levin: The structure that they use.\nAriel Levin: Like are they using.\nAriel Levin: Do they have like different vehicles within the text?\nAriel Levin: Like comparisons, case studies, tables.\nyusheng kuo: Hey Bose, what are the vehicles?\nyusheng kuo: Sorry?\nyusheng kuo: What are the vehicles of their study?\nyusheng kuo: Is that the right word?\nAriel Levin: No, I don't think that's the right word.\nyusheng kuo: How do I, how do I describe it?\nAriel Levin: Just ask.\nAriel Levin: I mean like what are they using to make their points more accessible, clearer.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, cool.\nAriel Levin: Like what are they using?\nAriel Levin: Are they using tables?\nAriel Levin: Are they using.\nAriel Levin: Whatever.\nyusheng kuo: It's okay because we have the full content saved up.\nyusheng kuo: So later on we can, we can re.\nyusheng kuo: Ask them to review this again.\nyusheng kuo: So now you see, he's trying to basically go ahead and try to read everything on his own.\nyusheng kuo: He would kind of decided that.\nyusheng kuo: And he will also try to read the YouTube transcript.\nAriel Levin: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So the most important step is like embed your process.\nyusheng kuo: Like describe your process as clear as good as possible.\nyusheng kuo: Because I don't know how to analyze the content.\nyusheng kuo: You know how to analyze content and then the most important thing, you know what a good content like good extraction look like.\nyusheng kuo: I don't.\nyusheng kuo: And you can based on the output say okay, I don't be very critical.\nyusheng kuo: So you have this kind of feedback loop tracing in your context window.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so tell me what you think about this.\nyusheng kuo: Like where they use.\nyusheng kuo: They want to go like concrete before.\nyusheng kuo: After numbers for their case study have.\nyusheng kuo: A name, company jobs in the live.\nyusheng kuo: Walkthrough screen recording feel too generic or what?\nyusheng kuo: Like how would you.\nyusheng kuo: No, no, no, no, no.\nyusheng kuo: Don't, don't settle.\nyusheng kuo: Like give it at least another feedback so it's like more concrete to show.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Because otherwise it will become slop or like useless slot because like too trivial.\nyusheng kuo: Your job is making it non trivial.\nyusheng kuo: So people feel like, oh, this is insight, not like some generic AI study.\nyusheng kuo: How would you improve based on that?\nyusheng kuo: I would try to challenge you on that.\nyusheng kuo: How would you better improve this output so later on your affiliation have very good content.\nAriel Levin: Look, I think live walkthroughs and screen recordings are not something that, that we can actually use because like what we want to do is we want to create things in val.\nAriel Levin: So I lost your screen, but this is something that like I won't be able to use because they, I won't be able to use that.\nAriel Levin: So that's thing.\nAriel Levin: And if you share your screen again, that'll be good.\nyusheng kuo: Oh yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I couldn't now for some reason.\nyusheng kuo: Wait, let me turn off the camera.\nyusheng kuo: Let me reload the pages.\nyusheng kuo: All right.\nAriel Levin: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So you say this is non usable?\nyusheng kuo: Like basically.\nAriel Levin: No, just, just the, just the third one, the live stream walkthrough.\nAriel Levin: Like it's not something that I, I could use.\nAriel Levin: I want to extract the content.\nAriel Levin: Relatable person scenario.\nyusheng kuo: Can you describe, like, can you describe why you cannot use it?\nyusheng kuo: Like give it that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAriel Levin: So what we're doing in this engine is we're creating articles and we want to do that in val.\nAriel Levin: So we won't be doing any video walkthroughs or anything like that.\nAriel Levin: Unless there's a way to create a decent, I guess main written walkthrough.\nAriel Levin: But that would require taking images like screenshots and that would require some human intervention because we can't, we don't want to blindly steal screenshots from the video.\nAriel Levin: First, it's not going to look good and second, it's.\nAriel Levin: It's not cool.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAriel Levin: To do that.\nAriel Levin: Yeah.\nAriel Levin: Also.\nyusheng kuo: But actually I, I have a question.\nyusheng kuo: Like I actually want people to help.\nyusheng kuo: Us to do like Walthew in documentation.\nAriel Levin: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Like for my product.\nyusheng kuo: Like how, how difficult it is.\nAriel Levin: Oh, it's not difficult.\nAriel Levin: It's just logging in, taking screenshots.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, I see.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: But I just say like from my perspective, actually if someone can like help us to provide like a really detailed walk through, that's like really nice.\nyusheng kuo: Sorry, Sorry to sideway that.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, go on.\nyusheng kuo: Honest struggle narrative.\nyusheng kuo: What else like you think will be useful.\nyusheng kuo: For your next step.\nyusheng kuo: Basically.\nAriel Levin: I don't think relatable Persona scenarios.\nAriel Levin: I want it to be pretty like an honest struggle narrative.\nAriel Levin: Well, Yeah, because.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAriel Levin: Alan.\nyusheng kuo: Hey.\nAriel Levin: My next meeting is here and we're.\nyusheng kuo: A bit out of time.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAriel Levin: So tell me how you want to continue this.\nAriel Levin: We can make another time or whatever.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: So just a quick question.\nyusheng kuo: So how do you want this partnership going on?\nyusheng kuo: Basically, if we want, this is how we will build agent.\nyusheng kuo: So I would try to interview you or let cloud code interview you.\nyusheng kuo: We can have a shared repository and.\nyusheng kuo: I need you to create really, really.\nyusheng kuo: Good contacts so no one else can create like.\nAriel Levin: I mean, I suggest.\nAriel Levin: I suggest.\nAriel Levin: Look, tell me.\nAriel Levin: Tell me what you need for me.\nAriel Levin: Tell me what's the best scenario for you.\nAriel Levin: Write.\nAriel Levin: Write to me on LinkedIn or via email and then.\nAriel Levin: And then we can communicate.\nAriel Levin: I mean, I'll get back to you tomorrow.\nAriel Levin: I just.\nAriel Levin: I just have a.\nAriel Levin: My next video is here.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, cool.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, talk to you.\nyusheng kuo: Bye.\nAriel Levin: All right, talk soon, man.\nAriel Levin: Cheers.\nAriel Levin: Bye.\nTitle: 30 Min Meeting between Yusheng Kuo and Ariel Levin\nHost Email:
