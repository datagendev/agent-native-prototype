I think if you use parallel.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Especially for this kind of web facts thing.\nyusheng kuo: Have you tried parallel or link up?\nDavid Kwint: No, I really haven't found a good use case for it yet.\nyusheng kuo: Oh no.\nyusheng kuo: I mean even for like a phone number or like a number of employees?\nDavid Kwint: No, not really.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I think that the easiest way is you go to their website and ask the same question and see what's the result look like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I heard it's pretty cheap because it's well subsidized at the moment and from a lot of benchmark it seems they are the best.\nyusheng kuo: They have the best performance like a web knowledge performance maybe even better than Clay gen. Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: And there I can also just connect the API to Clay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: They have that also API first company and I think they even give you like a free credit for quite.\nyusheng kuo: Quite generous.\nyusheng kuo: I haven't started to pay either.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nDavid Kwint: I, I have another client who.\nDavid Kwint: I could try this because like for telephone numbers are already.\nDavid Kwint: It's already finished.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I'm just saying like I you kind of recall that parallel might be the good option and it's like simple.\nyusheng kuo: Just like one API call doesn't need to configure too much thing.\nyusheng kuo: Cool.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, thanks again letting me complete the setup.\nyusheng kuo: I think the purpose is I really want to know if it's kind of working in a real work like real life situation.\nyusheng kuo: So can you like turn on your terminal, see where we left last time?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: See if it actually found out.\nyusheng kuo: So I would really recommend if you do shift tab you can get into like a plan mode, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then, and then like for this type of thing you can use plan mode to first like especially I create agent.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nDavid Kwint: Actually I'm running this right now where I'm trying to see what they think.\nDavid Kwint: What like yeah.\nDavid Kwint: How we could potentially replace Clay I see.\nyusheng kuo: But why I keep hearing people want to replace Clay, like either with.\nyusheng kuo: And then I got like you also saying like trigger.dev right.\nyusheng kuo: I also get another one.\nyusheng kuo: Really want to replace Clay manual.\nyusheng kuo: Why?\nyusheng kuo: Like, what's the main reason that people want to like accidentify play?\nDavid Kwint: So first of all, Clay has a 50,000 roll limit, which is sometimes annoying if you have a big list.\nDavid Kwint: Then it's also pretty slow sometimes and pretty expensive as well if you want to connect your CRM with it.\nDavid Kwint: Like, you need to pay for the 800 plan, which is oftentimes too expensive for some companies.\nyusheng kuo: Because they just want to connect to their CRM.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: I mean the Explorer plan, which has all the functionalities that you need, basically is 350.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: And then if you want to connect your CRM, it's like 450 on top of this, which is like.\nDavid Kwint: Doesn't really make sense.\nyusheng kuo: I just try to rip you off.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I see it.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: How slow is.\nyusheng kuo: Actually?\nyusheng kuo: It's.\nDavid Kwint: It's pretty slow.\nDavid Kwint: It could be.\nDavid Kwint: It can be pretty slow sometimes.\nDavid Kwint: Like especially running Claytons on like 10, 000 rolls can sometimes take like half an hour.\nyusheng kuo: 10,000 row for Clay Jing with like half an hour.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: Sometimes even more.\nDavid Kwint: Depends on the prompt, obviously.\nDavid Kwint: But.\nyusheng kuo: Wait, you mean just like one column or like the whole table?\nDavid Kwint: No, one column.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, just one column.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: I see.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: Especially like, like HubSpot lookups.\nDavid Kwint: They take like, if you want to do a HubSpot lookup of like contacts or companies for 30,000 rows, then it's like four hours.\nyusheng kuo: Wow.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: And then they don't really have a way if you fail, you cannot like know it.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Until you see it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: You don't send out a new piece.\nDavid Kwint: It doesn't really fail, to be honest.\nyusheng kuo: It's just.\nDavid Kwint: It just keeps retrying.\nyusheng kuo: I see.\nDavid Kwint: But eventually they're like.\nDavid Kwint: You almost have no failures in there, but it also takes a huge amount of time.\nyusheng kuo: But what's the option?\nyusheng kuo: Like the.\nDavid Kwint: I don't know.\nDavid Kwint: What's the.\nDavid Kwint: Like you mean what an alternative.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: I don't know.\nDavid Kwint: Maybe like some kind of super.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, because.\nDavid Kwint: Or like hotspot, MCP or anything like that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Because the thing is like, I've tried something I would say actually plays quite.\nyusheng kuo: Quite reliable.\nyusheng kuo: It's like there's a reason why it's kind of the.\nyusheng kuo: Because there are many similar tool.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like a data bar, like Freo, all these things.\nyusheng kuo: But clearly in terms of the feature like feature set and reliability, it's really like up there.\nyusheng kuo: You could try trigger dev, but I doubt it will be much faster, but it will be cheaper.\nyusheng kuo: But then you have to code out everything.\nyusheng kuo: Like any CRM integration, you have to code it up and you have to follow some decorator syntax like task.\nyusheng kuo: That's what typical this kind of pipeline, durability pipeline look like.\nyusheng kuo: They basically dissect the whole testlet into a lot of a small chunk and then try to retry again and again like.\nyusheng kuo: Like clay, but in a more distributed way.\nyusheng kuo: So.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, I. I really don't know.\nyusheng kuo: Like, I keep hearing people ask me that, but I just really don't know if there's like even.\nyusheng kuo: Anyway, I don't know how.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: And it's not really a.\nDavid Kwint: Alternative to.\nDavid Kwint: To Clay, I would say.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So it's like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, we'll see.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nDavid Kwint: So we need to.\nyusheng kuo: No, I think.\nyusheng kuo: I think this is not what we were doing.\nyusheng kuo: I think we're trying to do the February 10th.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's kind of like missing this with the.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, just the February 10th one.\nyusheng kuo: They're focusing on February 10th scripts.\nDavid Kwint: By the way, I have another client where it's unclear how we are going to work together from here from this point on because most of the workflows and systems already have been done for them.\nDavid Kwint: But what kind of is interesting to them is what I proposed is basically let me put this up.\nDavid Kwint: Like context system for them.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nDavid Kwint: On lead and company basis.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: And yeah, this I have like the founder of this company asked me for a demo or anything like she could like actually see for himself.\nDavid Kwint: But I said like I don't have anything ready.\nyusheng kuo: Really.\nDavid Kwint: And it's also unclear how this would look like in practice for them.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: So I wanted to ask you because we want to partner on such things.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: If you have any like potential reviews or agents that I could show him.\nDavid Kwint: Like for example, I think what they would benefit is like the CRM analysis.\nDavid Kwint: Right.\nDavid Kwint: Of.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nDavid Kwint: For the AES, for example.\nDavid Kwint: Like this could be part of it and something that they could interact with or see.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: Like I wanted to ask you if you would be open to.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, totally.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: You don't.\nDavid Kwint: You don't.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, I'm.\nyusheng kuo: I'm open.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nDavid Kwint: You don't have to build something completely from scratch, but like just.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I think it's nice for us to know what actually people want and see some patterns.\nyusheng kuo: So we can provide that as a template like for like both for agency and then like for you.\nyusheng kuo: Then you don't need to Start from the scratch.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, I'm all in to this is why exactly what I want to try to like partner with like I would provide the technical support and even like a kickstart and then you can try to refine based on your understanding of the client what you want to do.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, yeah, this is the client liro.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: And I have some context on them, but not really that much.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: Okay, what are you like, do you want to send anything like that you have already ready or do you want to build something custom to them or like how would you.\nyusheng kuo: So first of all, do they.\nyusheng kuo: What, what CRM are they using?\nDavid Kwint: Hotspot.\nyusheng kuo: Hotspot.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Do you have the access to the API key or.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure about the API key, but Access token, access to HubSpot.\nDavid Kwint: Let me check.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, I have a HubSpot account on them.\nDavid Kwint: I'm not sure if I have the rights to create an API key.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: List the read token.\nyusheng kuo: But if you have the access token, we should be able to.\nyusheng kuo: If you can log in, then you should be able to.\nyusheng kuo: To log in through the OAuth and then you should be able to.\nyusheng kuo: I can show you shortly.\nyusheng kuo: And then we can try to like read from the.\nyusheng kuo: Because the, the original one that we built was through the API hotspot API.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know if you can get some like the API key from them.\nyusheng kuo: Like a re.\nyusheng kuo: Access only.\nyusheng kuo: Do you think they know how to.\nyusheng kuo: Do you think they know how to do it?\nDavid Kwint: Would love to share this just with you, but this is all in German.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: It doesn't really work, but let me just try to get this.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: So this is basically the keys and this is developer API key.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, that's the one that we need.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I don't read this.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: But yeah, I don't understand any of it.\nDavid Kwint: Personal API key.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, that's good enough.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, let me send you one.\nyusheng kuo: I think the original prompt he created is a bit like aligned to the customer.\nyusheng kuo: So I don't know how truncated is, but it could be like a starting point.\nyusheng kuo: So basically you can read the script and to understand how to pull the data and then you can refine the skill part and the agent part and we can see how.\nDavid Kwint: So this can actually read all of it, I think.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, that's.\nyusheng kuo: It's good now.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, it can't write anything so there is no possibility of it up.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, you don't need to give it to me.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, you don't need to give it to me.\nyusheng kuo: Just.\nDavid Kwint: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I mean, I just try to make sure this.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.\nyusheng kuo: I mean, if you.\nyusheng kuo: If you want me to like take a look and.\nyusheng kuo: Because it will be faster for me to.\nyusheng kuo: To.\nDavid Kwint: I mean, you can't write anything in there anyways.\nDavid Kwint: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So there is no.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, yeah, I paste it in the chat.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, let me save it.\nyusheng kuo: Perfect.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Let me actually.\nyusheng kuo: Just give me one second.\nyusheng kuo: Let me create a space so I have this save already.\nyusheng kuo: Where is my lowest.\nyusheng kuo: Just one second.\nyusheng kuo: What's the company name?\nyusheng kuo: Can you spell for me?\nDavid Kwint: 0 b l I r o IO.\nyusheng kuo: B a I R O. Yeah, paste it in chat.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, B L, I R O. Plural.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: What's their customer like?\nyusheng kuo: You know, like typical ICP profile.\nDavid Kwint: Usually it's manufacturing or companies.\nDavid Kwint: It's like a.\nDavid Kwint: It's like fathom, but GDPR compliant.\nDavid Kwint: Like a.\nDavid Kwint: Not that.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, like fireflies, but.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, okay.\nDavid Kwint: Without a meeting.\nDavid Kwint: Bots.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: But why it's manufacturing?\nyusheng kuo: Like, I thought it's like any B2B would like this kind of reading.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, it's really.\nDavid Kwint: To be honest, it's really any B2B that has kind of a big sales team and which is selling remotely as well as at the customer because they also have an app and they can just record conversations on their phone when they're at the customer.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, I see.\nyusheng kuo: So.\nyusheng kuo: So it's actually turned out like the real ICP is the manufacturing for that.\nyusheng kuo: Like, it should be more differentiation.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, this is a big part.\nDavid Kwint: But really, like in the last months we figured out that it's really any company that's has a sales team, like over 20 people and is selling remotely as well as going to the customer to sell.\nDavid Kwint: Cool.\nyusheng kuo: I see.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Let me.\nyusheng kuo: Let me actually do something and then you can have a look and then we can like refine it.\nyusheng kuo: Because I think eventually you will be the taste gatekeeper.\nyusheng kuo: And then if you.\nyusheng kuo: If you feel comfortable building agent and then you can quickly deploy them and then you can send them the email to let them look like and then give you some kind of feedback.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So let's get back to this instantly.\nyusheng kuo: Let's try to finish this one.\nyusheng kuo: It should be quick, I hope.\nyusheng kuo: But let's get out of this.\nyusheng kuo: Let's try to do resume, see if we can get back to our context.\nyusheng kuo: Last time.\nyusheng kuo: Just Control C. Control C. Control C. Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Because I think this one seems like already kind of brand rocket.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: So what should I ask?\nyusheng kuo: Just Control C again, let's go out of the Terminal.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Control C to.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, to Control C. Cloud resume.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, Cloud dash dash resume or dash R. The dash R. Dash R. So that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah there's some.\nyusheng kuo: Something I think teach is like typically in terminal you have like comment and argument and if dash dash typically is the full argument name, like a dash resume and dash typically will come with like a shorthand, like a dash R. So that's why like the command line interface always look like it's so obscure because they always use like a shorthand.\nyusheng kuo: You have no idea what it is.\nyusheng kuo: Now we can try to see if we can find that one.\nDavid Kwint: How can I scroll down controller just.\nyusheng kuo: You just hit down arrow down.\nDavid Kwint: No, I'm doing arrow down but doesn't work.\nyusheng kuo: Oh it doesn't work.\nyusheng kuo: Oh yeah, it's weird.\nyusheng kuo: It doesn't.\nyusheng kuo: Wait, what is a bug or maybe wait, let me see.\nDavid Kwint: Can't even do escape.\nDavid Kwint: Escape is also.\nyusheng kuo: I think, I think it's.\nyusheng kuo: It's froze.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it should be arrow down.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Let's try another terminal.\nyusheng kuo: Just contrast.\nyusheng kuo: I think this one is froze.\nDavid Kwint: Control C is also not working.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's just close.\nyusheng kuo: Right click the node and then close the terminal.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's weird.\nDavid Kwint: Oh no.\nyusheng kuo: It works.\nyusheng kuo: Oh yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so scroll further down.\nyusheng kuo: I think the 1 week ago 1 request interrupted by user for 2 use is that 1.\nyusheng kuo: When did we talk?\nDavid Kwint: No, this was.\nDavid Kwint: I think I want to monitor reply rate.\nyusheng kuo: Oh yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Cool, cool.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah this is the one.\nyusheng kuo: Where are we this campaign for each campaign ganytic print result.\nyusheng kuo: So do we already have that?\nyusheng kuo: Like yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Can you ask it to.\nyusheng kuo: Can you run it again and let us see the result?\nyusheng kuo: So I also.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, this is like.\nyusheng kuo: This is another thing.\nyusheng kuo: Is that one one area just like intake form.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: I'm thinking like how could you actually continue to provide some service as an agent, your service and agent to this their customers repository.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And then you can even do like enrichment for that.\nyusheng kuo: You basically pre connect all the skill agent MCP necessary, even their CRM.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nDavid Kwint: And they can continue to also what's I think really valuable is that what.\nDavid Kwint: I don't think they do that as much like they're a note taking company and they have so much data on their own.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: Discovery calls and also leveraging that is I think the most interesting part because they have also a webhook and API that we could connect to.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So they use their own product internally, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so that's interesting.\nyusheng kuo: You can even hook up their first body data and just make sure it's all re accessed.\nyusheng kuo: So you can basically just create the knowledge graph for them and then you can do for example, UCO can.\nyusheng kuo: That's something I really hope Clay will open up.\nyusheng kuo: Because if Clay can open up their mcp, then you can even push all the lead list to webhook to webhook to Clay and then get the result out of it.\nyusheng kuo: One way I can think of this, you can basically create a very simple Clay template.\nyusheng kuo: So the Clay template only do few things.\nyusheng kuo: Like you predict, find a template and then the first client column is always accepting the webhook.\nyusheng kuo: So you can just keep using like cloud code agent to send the deletes to them.\nyusheng kuo: So you can basically continue to feed them the pipeline.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then save that to like a supabase by the end of the column.\nyusheng kuo: So they also always like already kind of deduplicate anything and like you say like using their own like, like a webpool data and every time just give them the, the meeting intelligence.\nyusheng kuo: Like gone.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Do they have gone?\nDavid Kwint: No, they just use Liro.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: So yeah, yeah, Lira also has.\nDavid Kwint: I mean I can show you how it looks like they also have like sales intelligence in there.\nDavid Kwint: I mean this is also in German, but yeah, you have like different analysis, analysis types.\nDavid Kwint: So this is like the summary.\nDavid Kwint: And then you also have like customer questions and like spice analysis sales.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So this can all be pushed to through the webhook.\nDavid Kwint: I think so, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And this is also like Firefly.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: And this is also pushed directly into their CRM.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, okay.\nyusheng kuo: So we can directly actually pull from CRM.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, I think so.\nyusheng kuo: What do you think will be useful with this?\nyusheng kuo: Like from your view.\nDavid Kwint: Like what kind of agents would be useful?\nyusheng kuo: It's just like what kind of useful information or action can they take based on this?\nDavid Kwint: Like customer success?\nDavid Kwint: Like for example, because for customer success, give us the information of what kind of customer, like what the customer is caring about, what customer is like potentially churning soon.\nDavid Kwint: What kind of problems do the customers have then Discovery calls is good to.\nDavid Kwint: Discovery course is good to analyze like.\nyusheng kuo: Right, right.\nDavid Kwint: What are the biggest objections and what kind of value propositions are the most compelling for the potential customer and what's the close rate like?\nDavid Kwint: Like what, what AE has the best close rate and what industry has the best close rate?\nDavid Kwint: What, what, what industry?\nDavid Kwint: What value proposition?\nDavid Kwint: What pain is the best close rate and so on.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, there's just so much data that the people like the CEO would care about.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Let me actually show you something real quick.\nyusheng kuo: While you're waiting for the agent to crunch into his own memory.\nyusheng kuo: I actually just did this earlier today.\nyusheng kuo: I was trying to understand my Hay Reach performance.\nyusheng kuo: So I created this.\nyusheng kuo: You can see my screen, right?\nyusheng kuo: So I.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, I created this like Hay Reach.\nyusheng kuo: It basically read through my message, every message.\nyusheng kuo: I use Heyreach2 as my inbox, unified inbox.\nyusheng kuo: And it just reads through all of my message and try to summarize the thing and who should I contact first.\nyusheng kuo: I actually just deploy that to here.\nyusheng kuo: Later on we will go through this.\nyusheng kuo: So it's very simple to create.\nyusheng kuo: So here's a conversation summary.\nyusheng kuo: I just feel like this is very similar to what you say.\nyusheng kuo: So here it's like they basically just like this agent just crunch through, right?\nyusheng kuo: And eventually we'll come up with some like summary of all my conversation.\nyusheng kuo: Like who I talk to, who should I talk to.\nyusheng kuo: And then I can even add like the follow up question.\nyusheng kuo: Like I ask it through cloud code, but you can ask this through like email.\nyusheng kuo: And he actually gave me like really nice summary.\nyusheng kuo: Like for example, I talked to Jordan and he said oh, you probably should like respect his boundary.\nyusheng kuo: And Josh.\nyusheng kuo: And then I ask you some question like Stephen Brady, Adam asking him some question and he can come up with like a draft.\nyusheng kuo: I was still exploring what I can do with this agent.\nyusheng kuo: So ask it like, okay, give me first the prioritization of who should I contact and what should I contact it with and why this would be important for me.\nyusheng kuo: So I think this could be something very similar.\nyusheng kuo: Agent.\nyusheng kuo: It's like crunching through all the transcript data, right.\nyusheng kuo: And maybe like say comes through the last week or like last two weeks.\nyusheng kuo: Like here I set up like the last two weeks and then what would be like a strategy?\nyusheng kuo: Like what's the key principle?\nyusheng kuo: How do I reach out to them again?\nyusheng kuo: So I think we just need to slightly change the thing here.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: What actually people both are complaining about what kind of feature they actually want to pull.\nyusheng kuo: So we can actually directly use this to create a feature request bot.\nyusheng kuo: We can basically have a different section of this summary.\nyusheng kuo: What are the feature requests, what are the major complaint?\nyusheng kuo: What are the main pain points they want to solve?\nyusheng kuo: And because their tool give you like individual transcript summary.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: But doesn't give you like a holistic summary.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, because that, that would require cloud code level of recursive like polling.\nyusheng kuo: You couldn't like split everything just into one agent call.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Maybe they eventually like turn this into a product.\nyusheng kuo: Who knows.\nyusheng kuo: But this would very useful because like you could pull other like CRM information for this customer.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like you can even group by.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: For this type of manufacturing customer this is more like a common thing.\nyusheng kuo: So that's where your, your taste is kind of coming in.\nyusheng kuo: Like you need to kind of dictate what are the interest, what are the potential like interested like information that they might be want.\nyusheng kuo: But just saying like it's very doable and I think it's like it will be the.\nyusheng kuo: For me like this is useful to kind of coach myself.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, right.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah it's the same for them.\nDavid Kwint: Basically they want to figure out like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Do better.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah yeah.\nyusheng kuo: We now like have a product agent who tell us like what are the failures.\nyusheng kuo: So that's where we find out like a linking person search.\nyusheng kuo: I just the agents I realize okay, I have this keep battling everyone and I ask agent development agent to figure out why this is failing and what are the failing type that's coming and I just fix it.\nyusheng kuo: It's just like if you start to use AI in every aspect they can actually now doing a lot of stuff in sequential not just like in one aspect.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so where we are.\nyusheng kuo: So is this correct?\nyusheng kuo: Is this what you want?\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, this is exactly what I want.\nyusheng kuo: Okay then let's do.\nDavid Kwint: Only 11 out of 21.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nDavid Kwint: Yes, some.\nDavid Kwint: I think some domains are still left out but this is exactly what I want.\nyusheng kuo: 100 email sample per campaign.\nyusheng kuo: What does that mean?\nyusheng kuo: Why, why do you know why it left you mean?\nDavid Kwint: I think like he took every campaign that I have and then analyzed just 100 emails of the campaign.\nDavid Kwint: Although like the campaign could have been like 5,000 events.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, But.\nyusheng kuo: But like let's, let's.\nyusheng kuo: I think it's actually not hard to pull like can you ask it to like pull the whole thing that just like.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, she's asking me to increase the sample size.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So the, the goal of this is try to reach where you want it to be and then now we can deploy the agent for it.\nyusheng kuo: So like this is like important.\nyusheng kuo: I actually created the.\nyusheng kuo: So last time I told you like I feel this is too manual.\nyusheng kuo: I actually create a prompt to let you create an agent end to end and you can kind of try try like after this.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Cool.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah that's nice.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: If you type slash, don't run it out but if you type slash and data gen. Yeah see like build cloud code agent later on if you want.\nyusheng kuo: You want to play you can use that.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, I definitely play around with.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, let's see.\nyusheng kuo: Let's wait for it.\nyusheng kuo: It probably would Take a while.\nDavid Kwint: I'm going to the toilet.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nDavid Kwint: By the way, for hey care, you gave me that agent, right that you created with like the research on a company level.\nDavid Kwint: Right.\nDavid Kwint: How would you deploy that in clay?\nDavid Kwint: Do you think that's deployable on scale in clay for like all company domains in the 10?\nDavid Kwint: You're still muted.\nDavid Kwint: You're muted by the way.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, sorry.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I'm just talking to myself.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so that's something I don't know because cloud code seems still low.\nDavid Kwint: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so like yeah, it's like it can create like a whole enrichment group.\nyusheng kuo: But I don't know if like running like, like what the typical.\nyusheng kuo: Like the size of your.\nyusheng kuo: Your.\nyusheng kuo: Your league.\nyusheng kuo: You, you.\nyusheng kuo: You were wrong.\nDavid Kwint: Like 10,000 companies.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, 10,000 company.\nyusheng kuo: Let me try to run it and see how it goes.\nyusheng kuo: We do can like scale horizontally.\nyusheng kuo: It doesn't.\nyusheng kuo: It's not an issue.\nyusheng kuo: I just don't know if all 10,000 lead.\nyusheng kuo: Is like hitting the same endpoint, what would it be like?\nyusheng kuo: Because I told you earlier this week, we start to ramp up our volume, right.\nyusheng kuo: So 10,000 lead and we start to see some bottleneck of the scale.\nyusheng kuo: And that's something we are addressing one way.\nyusheng kuo: The easiest way we just kind of go scaling like horizontally.\nyusheng kuo: So it can actually hit different server basically.\nyusheng kuo: So that's one.\nyusheng kuo: And also we employ that to different.\nyusheng kuo: Different like a vendor.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nDavid Kwint: What do you think?\nDavid Kwint: Like do you think it would be possible to like send the agent to cloud code basically analyze.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: What it does and then tell.\nDavid Kwint: Hey, try to program this into trigger.de for example.\nyusheng kuo: But that, yeah, that's one possible way.\nyusheng kuo: But then you have to deal with the code and the output of the code and then you think that sounds like too hard.\nyusheng kuo: No, it's not too hard.\nyusheng kuo: It's just like there are some stuff require cloud codes, like intelligence.\nyusheng kuo: Not like just code end to end.\nyusheng kuo: So like for example, like in the end you want.\nyusheng kuo: You need to know what like what like title to to cover.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like for example, if you find like you see here already have the number, you wouldn't go for another one.\nyusheng kuo: That type of thing is very hard to encode it.\nyusheng kuo: Just like the reason you use clayjean is because like it couldn't be like become a programmable thing.\nyusheng kuo: It's very depending on what the situation before it.\nyusheng kuo: But that's the part like even you deploy the trigger dev, it will still be slow because that basically is the LLM loop.\nyusheng kuo: Got it?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But let me try to give it a Try and see how bad it is.\nyusheng kuo: Because like, okay, if I can like ENRICH Like Whole50 column, right.\nyusheng kuo: And then like in two minutes, but I can do it at the same time like for all 10,000 column, then it doesn't matter.\nyusheng kuo: It's still too many and I get the full data back, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, that, that would be the goal.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: The next would be like the cost.\nyusheng kuo: What are the cost look like?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nDavid Kwint: But I mean you have to also think about like if that's possible without clay, then you save so much money.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's something I'm looking into too, I think.\nyusheng kuo: I talk to people who use clay and try to go out of the clay.\nyusheng kuo: The most important thing is that you need to have this kind of visualization layer which the trigger dev doesn't have.\nyusheng kuo: So clay become a very good monitor of like the.\nyusheng kuo: All your data.\nyusheng kuo: You can kind of see it, run it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So if we use this one, we have to find one that also have like nice grid view.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so that, that, that's the, that's the reason.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Let me, let me think about it.\nyusheng kuo: Because I, I now understand why people don't like clay.\nyusheng kuo: Because the, the, the ridiculous.\nyusheng kuo: The 500 Adam for just the identification.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nDavid Kwint: Like, yeah, go ahead.\nDavid Kwint: In my ideal world, like I want to just stay in cloth code basically and don't, don't need to do anything.\nDavid Kwint: And like I, I just have like I have all my frameworks in here.\nDavid Kwint: I, I know like how messages should be written in German and in English and I have all the context here that I need.\nDavid Kwint: And essentially what I want to just do is hey, this is all the context of the company.\nDavid Kwint: Come up with the playbook, come up with the messaging.\nDavid Kwint: I approve of the messaging.\nDavid Kwint: And then, and then build all the information.\nDavid Kwint: Here are like 20 APIs that you will need.\nDavid Kwint: Use all of them and create the info and like I could create all the data that you need and then send this to instantly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, the, the only thing really is the block is the scale and how reliable it is.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's like if it's a 10, 20 row.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, there's like.\nyusheng kuo: I don't, I don't think there's any issue.\nyusheng kuo: It's like when you run start to.\nyusheng kuo: There are a few things.\nyusheng kuo: Like when you start to run like in 10,000 row, 20,000 row, can it be run like reliably?\nyusheng kuo: Like even we are testing whether you can pull all the instantly data out properly.\nyusheng kuo: The second thing is when you need to run on schedule or say hey, I want my lead to be whenever I push something to my crn, it will also be automatically pushed to this table.\nyusheng kuo: That's like a two things.\nyusheng kuo: Because in cloud code, sorry, in clay you have this kind of deploy.\nyusheng kuo: Basically each table is deployed.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So you can send a webpool in.\nyusheng kuo: So that's the two thing that we need to figure out to.\nyusheng kuo: To actually replace the clay.\nyusheng kuo: Because I, I really heard a lot of people want to replace clay for.\nyusheng kuo: For some of the reason like you mentioned here and for the price reason.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And also like controllability.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nDavid Kwint: I mean if you can like get the same solution which is like 70% similar to clay, let's say like has 70% of the functionalities or a 70% as good, but costs like 200 bucks a month.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: Then it's already way better because then you like you save $600 a month.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: And maybe you, you have some.\nDavid Kwint: I can't even imagine that you can create something similar with even more capabilities.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Because now you have everything here.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: It's a very end to end.\nyusheng kuo: And I haven't been thinking about this kind of like basically it's an agent native client.\nyusheng kuo: One possibility is we use the SQLite as a backend.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: See what you get.\nyusheng kuo: Is it actually big?\nyusheng kuo: Like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, It shouldn't be that the big.\nyusheng kuo: Why is it not moving?\nyusheng kuo: Do you have like instantly API key?\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, I have it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Do you want to give it to me?\nyusheng kuo: And then you can rotate later on you can delete and then create one so I can create for you.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, I mean I already connected it to datagen.\nDavid Kwint: If you.\nyusheng kuo: Access do that it's in secret vault, so we couldn't like access it.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But thank you for your trust.\nyusheng kuo: Like so but let me try to use the one.\nyusheng kuo: Let's try to first create an agent here.\nyusheng kuo: So because you already have the thing, it's just like it's too big now and then it's probably using some like inefficient way to pull the data.\nyusheng kuo: So let's do.\nyusheng kuo: Just go do control B.\nyusheng kuo: Control control B.\nyusheng kuo: No, doesn't do anything just like.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, escape.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, you say.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, let's start.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so update what we've done.\nyusheng kuo: In AT means like a reference file dot cloud cloud and then agent slash agent.\nyusheng kuo: Wait, have we created this agent yet?\nyusheng kuo: There you should be in that cloud.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Here.\nDavid Kwint: No, I don't think so.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, what do you want to call it?\nyusheng kuo: That's okay, let's call it what we done in slash agent, slash whatever.\nDavid Kwint: Instantly.\nyusheng kuo: Domain Instantly domain reply.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Reply imd.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then space.\nyusheng kuo: And make sure you follow the respondent.\nyusheng kuo: Oh yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And make sure you follow the agent formatter.\nyusheng kuo: Like agent formatter format.\nDavid Kwint: Like this?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Format f o r m a t formatter format from matter is like the header.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: F o r a m a t after that from matter format.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's it.\nyusheng kuo: So this will create an agent.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I think one thing we can do is like.\nyusheng kuo: Like how many campaign you're running like simultaneously.\nDavid Kwint: For myself right now.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, I think six.\nyusheng kuo: Six.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: So that actually that 100 domains are all like active.\nyusheng kuo: Not just that 11.\nyusheng kuo: One.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, I see.\nDavid Kwint: I have four active and two completed.\nDavid Kwint: The reply rates have been pretty bad.\nyusheng kuo: What do you mean?\nDavid Kwint: These weren't good campaigns.\nDavid Kwint: I think either like my offer was not good enough in the campaign or my inboxes are.\nDavid Kwint: Because I had like last month I had a campaign which was really good at like 5% reply rate and then everything after that just promises in reply rate.\nyusheng kuo: The same company?\nDavid Kwint: No, no, it's different company.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, I see.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so let's see.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, now let's go.\nyusheng kuo: Let's do.\nyusheng kuo: Do you have a GitHub here?\nyusheng kuo: You say can you help me to push it?\nyusheng kuo: How many?\nyusheng kuo: And P. Okay, so now we can go to data gen here.\nyusheng kuo: Now it's just the full agent deployment.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: To data driven.\nyusheng kuo: Agent.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, and then you select the repo.\nyusheng kuo: This is the one, right?\nyusheng kuo: Oh no, no.\nyusheng kuo: You connect your repository.\nyusheng kuo: Connect your repository.\nyusheng kuo: This is not right.\nyusheng kuo: Install.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Or yeah, you have to sign in, Select your repository.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: And you just hit connect.\nyusheng kuo: Wait, can refresh.\nyusheng kuo: Sorry, can you go to connect and then disconnect first disconnect your GitHub account.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then.\nyusheng kuo: And also delete the one that's standard.\nyusheng kuo: Can I go back?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, because that was a disconnect.\nyusheng kuo: Just select one of the repository first.\nyusheng kuo: Save.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, Connect.\nyusheng kuo: You don't have the agent you.\nDavid Kwint: It could be that I don't have any agents right now here.\nyusheng kuo: Wait, but what's the one that we just created?\nDavid Kwint: Should the agents be here that we created?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, because it will actually auto discover the.\nyusheng kuo: The repo that we created.\nDavid Kwint: Maybe it's the wrong.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, I see.\nDavid Kwint: I need to delete the other one.\nDavid Kwint: It's not always confusing.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, now we have it.\nyusheng kuo: So you can see you have all the skill that you can deliver here.\nyusheng kuo: Now you can do deployment for example, like onboard client, whatever.\nyusheng kuo: It will create like a webhook for you.\nyusheng kuo: So you can send your fill form right like whatever.\nyusheng kuo: Send to this and it will create.\nyusheng kuo: Let's go down to the.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so what you need to do is you want to use the cloud code oauth token.\nyusheng kuo: So the way you do it is you go to your cloud, you go back to terminal.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, Go back to the Terminal 1.\nyusheng kuo: So create a terminal.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then type cloud setup token.\nyusheng kuo: Cloud space setup token.\nyusheng kuo: S E tup dash token.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Save this one.\nyusheng kuo: So the.\nyusheng kuo: You see the SDK.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So you can actually use it for any cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: Instance online and use your cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: So you say cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: You also save.\nyusheng kuo: Let's first save.\nyusheng kuo: Go to datajet.\nyusheng kuo: So this is the one times up.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And go to add secret.\nyusheng kuo: Yes, add and then type the cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: You remember what the.\nyusheng kuo: It has to be underscore.\nyusheng kuo: Underscore.\nyusheng kuo: O.\nyusheng kuo: No, not API call Underscore code.\nyusheng kuo: It has to be the same name.\nyusheng kuo: Underscore.\nyusheng kuo: OO.\nDavid Kwint: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Because the cloud will actually read the names.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Just create secret and then you go back.\nyusheng kuo: The one we.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Now one thing you can set up is like I have a default prompt.\nyusheng kuo: So you would try to use the insulin domain.\nyusheng kuo: Put pry to.\nyusheng kuo: You can say use this agent to analyze last.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know, like last campaign or whatever.\nyusheng kuo: You have to give it the agent name, which is the instantly domain reply rate agent.\nDavid Kwint: Like this?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Does that make sense to you?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: This is.\nyusheng kuo: Then you can schedule it to run daily.\nyusheng kuo: So you hit deploy agent.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So now you have a web hook for this agent.\nyusheng kuo: So you can like create anywhere.\nyusheng kuo: And then you can schedule it to send my email to you.\nyusheng kuo: Just give it a name.\nyusheng kuo: At what time?\nyusheng kuo: And just like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, 10am means and then time zone.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: And then just an X. Yeah, you don't need to because you won't send the webhook in.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So you can just save next.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: You also.\nyusheng kuo: Sorry, you have to go down.\nyusheng kuo: You have to save.\nyusheng kuo: So save the setting for the API key first.\nyusheng kuo: Save the setting for API key.\nyusheng kuo: The top one and the.\nyusheng kuo: The top one of the safe setting.\nDavid Kwint: And here.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, save it and also scroll down the.\nyusheng kuo: See like your prom is actually gone.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So just the.\nyusheng kuo: The bottom part.\nyusheng kuo: Analyz.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, save it and then.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's it.\nyusheng kuo: You can review your agent here.\nyusheng kuo: Just scroll down.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, you can see what actually the prompt is.\nyusheng kuo: So you can actually update the prompt and you just like.\nDavid Kwint: In.\nyusheng kuo: What's it called?\nyusheng kuo: Like in cloud code, whenever you make a change, you can just say hey, push it and then it will actually be updated.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: You can also test it to run now and see the result and then also go to notification notification notification next schedule next to schedule like agent schedule.\nyusheng kuo: No down like right, like agent schedule notification.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, now turn on that.\nyusheng kuo: So you see all the notification.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, save it.\nyusheng kuo: So here's the thing.\nyusheng kuo: Now like for example, you have a client, right.\nyusheng kuo: You can actually just like add more recipient.\nyusheng kuo: So you.\nyusheng kuo: You see this, you see the agent output and then you're whoever that there are two type.\nyusheng kuo: It's a fewer they couldn't reply.\nyusheng kuo: They only see the result.\nyusheng kuo: And then like if it's a CEO that like they can like a reply and then ask a question.\nyusheng kuo: So but you need to make sure the repository the scope of the repository is for that CEO only.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So create a new repository.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So that's it.\nyusheng kuo: That's how you.\nyusheng kuo: You can later on like run run it or you can.\nDavid Kwint: Is it also possible to deploy a Slack agent and then instead of like replying to the mail replying to Slack.\nyusheng kuo: We don't have that at the moment.\nyusheng kuo: We will ship it pretty soon.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah okay so that's I.\nyusheng kuo: Because the reason is because like Slack.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I think.\nyusheng kuo: I think I.\nyusheng kuo: We heard.\nyusheng kuo: We also heard other people like one like a Slack right.\nyusheng kuo: So they sent to the Slack but that we.\nyusheng kuo: We.\nyusheng kuo: We.\nyusheng kuo: We try to prioritize email first and but we.\nyusheng kuo: We will try to ship the.\nyusheng kuo: The Slack as soon as possible.\nyusheng kuo: You can do like a Slack like send the result to Slack through the Slack webhook in your agent prom.\nyusheng kuo: So by the end of the agent you activate Slack but you haven't been able to like a resp.\nyusheng kuo: So the entry prompt.\nyusheng kuo: So here's the thing.\nyusheng kuo: Like entry point and agent prompt are two different things.\nyusheng kuo: Entry point is like you in cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: You want to trigger that.\nyusheng kuo: But the agent prompt is what exactly?\nyusheng kuo: Actually that agent is like a skill.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So that's how you kind of end to end.\nyusheng kuo: And let's see, you can try to run now I'm not sure because it seems like an agent hasn't been able to figure out how to instantly reply right yet.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So I don't know if this prompt will actually give you another thing, but that's how you start to.\nyusheng kuo: And then I will actually test with your API if you can send me your Instantly API key and I will try to test it and I will see how actually be able to create the reply rate efficiently.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah yeah, I'll just paste it in here.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, sure.\nyusheng kuo: I will take it.\nyusheng kuo: And then like, after test it, just change the yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Or if you trust me, then.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, I trust you.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: This is instantly right.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I would do it now.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, cool.\nyusheng kuo: Thank you, David.\nyusheng kuo: Sorry, that's more.\nyusheng kuo: 30 minutes, but I will prepare this instantly and also go with the hotspot and let you know.\nyusheng kuo: I'll give you a brief agent and you can kind of use it to deploy that.\nDavid Kwint: Yep.\nDavid Kwint: Cool.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, cool.\nDavid Kwint: Thanks for watching.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: See you.\nTitle: 30 Min Meeting between Yusheng Kuo and
