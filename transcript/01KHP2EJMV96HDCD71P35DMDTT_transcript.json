hear me?\nyusheng kuo: Yes, yes, yes.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So you currently based in Toronto or.\nAnsh Bindal: I am based in Toronto, but right now I'm in India.\nAnsh Bindal: I'm in Bangalore.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so it's a vacation or you just currently are basing here?\nAnsh Bindal: I keep hopping between Toronto, Barcelona and Bangalore, India.\nAnsh Bindal: So escaping the winters.\nAnsh Bindal: How about yourself?\nyusheng kuo: Okay, that's nice.\nyusheng kuo: So it's mainly working remotely.\nAnsh Bindal: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: I see.\nyusheng kuo: And then now you are working for CO iq, is that.\nAnsh Bindal: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: So John.\nyusheng kuo: Is that John.\nyusheng kuo: So it's the CO IQ is who's the owner of it?\nAnsh Bindal: It's Mission Alex.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, let me actually says.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, okay.\nyusheng kuo: CO iq.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, tomorrow's gtm.\nyusheng kuo: So it's a.\nyusheng kuo: It's a.\nyusheng kuo: It's a whole.\nyusheng kuo: So what's the.\nyusheng kuo: It's a GTM system or it's more of a.\nyusheng kuo: So what do you do?\nAnsh Bindal: So I am a GTM engineer.\nAnsh Bindal: We build like systems using different tools, the primary tool being play and we build system for cold outbound either on LinkedIn or on email.\nyusheng kuo: I see.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: And then you mentioned you start to like building some kind of prospect website using cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nAnsh Bindal: I've done two things with cloud code.\nAnsh Bindal: One is build websites for prospects and second is I'm just playing around.\nyusheng kuo: It's nothing.\nyusheng kuo: Why do you need to build website prospect?\nyusheng kuo: Because that's part of the Surface or.\nAnsh Bindal: No, no, that's just me playing around.\nAnsh Bindal: It's just like my way of doing hello world with cloud.\nyusheng kuo: Like a Lee magnet type of thing.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, potentially, yeah.\nAnsh Bindal: Just to play around and see what it can do, what it can't do.\nAnsh Bindal: So yeah, just to play around.\nAnsh Bindal: And the second thing is decently yesterday I did deep research so I can just basically give it websites and say do deep research on this company and the founder and get back information.\nAnsh Bindal: And I created like a sub agent architecture for it so I can run multiple.\nAnsh Bindal: What do you say agents parallel.\nAnsh Bindal: So if I want to run 10, 20 different companies at once, do it so that my context printer doesn't get corrupt.\nyusheng kuo: Right, right, right.\nyusheng kuo: So you create a custom agent or use their building like a research agent too.\nAnsh Bindal: I used the mcp.\nAnsh Bindal: I used the EXA mcp.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nAnsh Bindal: And it's a free.\nAnsh Bindal: There's no API required for it.\nAnsh Bindal: So just connected it to my cloud code and it's doing the deep research.\nyusheng kuo: Wait, but you still need to pay for exa, right?\nAnsh Bindal: Like no, if you're on the free tier.\nAnsh Bindal: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, oh, they're free tier.\nyusheng kuo: I see.\nyusheng kuo: Do you know parallel?\nyusheng kuo: Have you heard of parallel I've heard.\nAnsh Bindal: About parallel and they are, they are.\nyusheng kuo: They are, they are much better in my opinion.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, but exa is like better at the like website.\nyusheng kuo: They just allow you to be but their information a lot about cache.\nyusheng kuo: So like not up to date.\nyusheng kuo: So I would be mindful of the answer.\nAnsh Bindal: What do you do?\nAnsh Bindal: How are you Good.\nAnsh Bindal: What's your core stack?\nyusheng kuo: So you mean the course that you mean like doing go to market or what am I currently like doing with cloud code?\nAnsh Bindal: Like what are you building?\nAnsh Bindal: What are you.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, so, so I, I, I, I view, I view two things.\nyusheng kuo: One is I build a lot of like around agent and also I use cloud code heavily on our own product, so.\nyusheng kuo: Our own product, I don't know if you checked it, it's called datadrin.dev so it's basically helping people to easily deploy their local cloud code to remote cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: So you can run like autonomously a bit like an open cloud.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nAnsh Bindal: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: So you can basically let your agent run on schedule or trigger by webhook.\nyusheng kuo: For example, I have an agent I created in Kauko and I deployed Java platform.\nyusheng kuo: So after Firefly finished this meeting, he will send a web to my agent and my agent will do the summary for me.\nyusheng kuo: So that would be like very.\nyusheng kuo: Because then my agent have all the context how I should do summary.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Compared to the generic like a Firefly summarization.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so that's like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so that's where we see the need for deployment of the Kauko.\nyusheng kuo: And so have you started to use like custom agent?\nyusheng kuo: Like create your own agent?\nAnsh Bindal: No, not yet.\nAnsh Bindal: Like I've just installed cloud code about like a week or two weeks ago and I'm just playing around it like two, three times.\nAnsh Bindal: Like now the next step I want to try and explore is, you know, what's that skills that everyone's talking about, like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah, agents.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So let's try to save the time because I have a hot limit in 20 minutes.\nyusheng kuo: So I will just share my screen and let's see if I can actually I can prepare a custom agent for you to deploy.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: And then let's see if we can have time to get into there.\nyusheng kuo: Let me see if you can see my screen.\nAnsh Bindal: I can, but it's very blurry right now.\nyusheng kuo: It's okay.\nyusheng kuo: Is it getting better now?\nAnsh Bindal: Yes, it is.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Do you see my obsidian?\nAnsh Bindal: Yes.\nAnsh Bindal: It's again blurry.\nAnsh Bindal: It says how to build agents Agent for.\nyusheng kuo: So I do one for each of it and I will give you the repository later on so you can play around.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: And you will see all the people I've been contacted.\nyusheng kuo: I will try to populate it here.\nyusheng kuo: So nothing like a personal information about it.\nyusheng kuo: It's just like basically like I tried to come up with the idea that can potentially be benefit to you like some kind of a demo of the agent.\nyusheng kuo: So first I want to, I want to emphasize like what we are doing here is not like using cloud code to build a traditional software.\nyusheng kuo: It's like cloud code is the center of the software.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: So that's where I call the agent os.\nyusheng kuo: So like cloud code is actually under the hood is the agent.\nyusheng kuo: So the way I define agent is that's LM with some kind of harness.\nyusheng kuo: So the hardness is just like for example the looping of an agent and knowing like when to stop.\nyusheng kuo: Like compact is a hardness.\nyusheng kuo: Custom sub agent is a harness.\nyusheng kuo: That's a term in like a cs basically is that like you give it some kind of like a tool for you to do his job.\nyusheng kuo: So cal code is the core, not the software you build.\nyusheng kuo: Like for example, I see a lot of people using cloud code and showing how they use doing cal code to replace clay, right?\nyusheng kuo: Doing cloud code to do their own CRM.\nyusheng kuo: That's like nice, but that's still 2010, right?\nyusheng kuo: You're still building cloud based software.\nyusheng kuo: This is not intelligent and every time you break, you have to fix it.\nyusheng kuo: And it's pretty not scalable, but it's different cases like agent is your core.\nyusheng kuo: You let agent to do the compute, not let agent write the script to do the compute.\nyusheng kuo: So that's different.\nyusheng kuo: So how do you know if it's an agent os?\nyusheng kuo: It's like, okay, does each request actually require agent to do the decision?\nyusheng kuo: One very vivid example is like open clock, right?\nyusheng kuo: Like it's a software called like personal os.\nyusheng kuo: But like every request is like through the agent, Agent decide how to handle the memory, Agent decide what to do and give you the result.\nyusheng kuo: So.\nyusheng kuo: So the result is that it's so adaptive in the agent.\nyusheng kuo: You still can have code, but the codes are cool.\nyusheng kuo: Do you lose me or are you still with me?\nyusheng kuo: No, because sometimes my screen will go, okay, so the codes are tools.\nyusheng kuo: So you don't be like a lot of people trying to build using codes to say I replace it to do something and then build a huge code base which you couldn't maintain.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Like if you are not like a professional software engineer.\nyusheng kuo: And that's what I call like you.\nyusheng kuo: I. Lucy, can you hear me now?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, but I Lose the screen.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Can you see now?\nyusheng kuo: No.\nyusheng kuo: Still now?\nyusheng kuo: No.\nyusheng kuo: My Google me.\nyusheng kuo: I really need to.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, okay.\nyusheng kuo: Can you see my screen?\nAnsh Bindal: Yes, it's blurred.\nAnsh Bindal: But you can keep speaking.\nAnsh Bindal: I think it takes a few seconds to come back to normal.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: The code is.\nyusheng kuo: You should build your code very maintainable, very lightweight, just like an MCP tool.\nyusheng kuo: But the agent can like a skill.\nyusheng kuo: It's very extensible.\nyusheng kuo: It's not like a highly dependent on other part of your code.\nyusheng kuo: A typical software like every part of function depend on the other part of the function.\nyusheng kuo: It's called like a monolithic code and then it's very hard to maintain.\nyusheng kuo: The fourth is like now the context is your code.\nyusheng kuo: So in comparison, like a typical software doesn't have the context.\nyusheng kuo: Like Clay table doesn't have the context.\nyusheng kuo: You build what you want and whatever you build there will be the context.\nyusheng kuo: Like agent os.\nyusheng kuo: You continue to add your memory, it will auto update itself as a context and that become his guidance of the code.\nyusheng kuo: And one thing we really want to do now is actually how can we help the agency to embed the expertise into the context.\nyusheng kuo: Because that was originally very hard to encode.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: A lot of your know how can be easily described in the documentation.\nyusheng kuo: But very hard to code it in the traditional sense of software.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: When you do this, do that.\nyusheng kuo: Like for example, like a multi channel in which like multi channel, like touchpoint.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like you would say okay, if they send me this email but get the LinkedIn message, what should I respond?\nyusheng kuo: If you try to do it in your workflow, it's a lot of if and else.\nyusheng kuo: But you can actually embed that 10 domain knowledge into this guideline as a context.\nyusheng kuo: That's another thing.\nyusheng kuo: The benefit of agent OS and then six is very adaptive.\nyusheng kuo: I want to give you an example of here.\nyusheng kuo: My agent every day will send out this kind of report of our product.\nyusheng kuo: Basically who used the product.\nyusheng kuo: What's the success way any kind of failure.\nyusheng kuo: This is ideal situation.\nyusheng kuo: Can you see my screen?\nyusheng kuo: Yes, but the other day I have the issue.\nyusheng kuo: He actually have the issue of the NEON query because I use NEON to do some kind of backup and then we have issue of Neon.\nyusheng kuo: So he actually wouldn't be able to access neon.\nyusheng kuo: He could still be able to access post hoc or whatever.\nyusheng kuo: In the traditional software I wouldn't get this email because it would just fail.\nyusheng kuo: He wouldn't respond or a lot of missing pieces here.\nyusheng kuo: But here because he still have some kind of my contacts, he knows how to so he have that skill.\nyusheng kuo: Of generate report.\nyusheng kuo: And because skill is adaptive, he actually changed the layout accordingly for this missing data part.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So I still get a report.\nyusheng kuo: I get the data collection notice saying hey, you should we.\nyusheng kuo: We have some issue here.\nyusheng kuo: But I still get the rest of the information.\nyusheng kuo: That's like impossible for the traditional or very hard to achieve.\nyusheng kuo: Like you need to create a lot of trikes that.\nyusheng kuo: To handle like to.\nyusheng kuo: To.\nyusheng kuo: To handle that kind of a situation.\nyusheng kuo: So that's why I mean it's adaptive, right?\nyusheng kuo: If you build your.\nyusheng kuo: If you build not like traditional software, using kaka to build traditional software, but using cloud code as the software, that's what you get.\nyusheng kuo: Very adaptive.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, so I would just go fast, you can stop me.\nyusheng kuo: And here I try to specify a little bit of what's different between agent and skill.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Because a lot of people ask me this question and then I don't think there's a single best answer.\nyusheng kuo: But to me that's how I separate them.\nyusheng kuo: So I would say agent is actually job to be done.\nyusheng kuo: For example, here I have a daily activity report that's like a job to be done.\nyusheng kuo: He needs to send me the report.\nyusheng kuo: But you need like three skill for this agent to complete his job.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: First you have to do this product analysis skill and then you have to report generator skill.\nyusheng kuo: And then finally he has this here he's using Slack poster, but I'm using email is another skill.\nyusheng kuo: How to send email is actually a simple MCP tool.\nyusheng kuo: The nice thing about composing your agent into skill set is every time you update the product analysis skill, right.\nyusheng kuo: All the agent that's dependent on this product skill will get updated.\nyusheng kuo: So you make your agent like a software.\nyusheng kuo: Like you compose them as software.\nyusheng kuo: So that's why I see skill as a capability and it should be modularized.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: You should make your skill very simple purpose so it can be reused in other like condition.\nyusheng kuo: Like I can basically I can reuse my report generator in my other report.\nyusheng kuo: That's it's not about daily activity, it's about my inbox.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, understood.\nAnsh Bindal: It's like a reusable function and like a code.\nyusheng kuo: Exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Like a tool.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's a higher level of the tool because tool now are more defined as like a script or MCP tool.\nyusheng kuo: It's like a code but still it's still a high level, like a guideline.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So it's like skill skill contents like agent have skill, skill have tool and tool have MCP to like sometimes you need to interact with like external service, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So that, that's the part of the.\nyusheng kuo: How I, how I show it.\nyusheng kuo: But I didn't show the tool here.\nyusheng kuo: But that's the idea.\nyusheng kuo: So tool should be the way.\nyusheng kuo: How do I divide tool?\nyusheng kuo: Tool is deterministic.\nyusheng kuo: It's like you have no way to change it and you need that part of the thing.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: And then it's very efficient.\nyusheng kuo: And then like it doesn't have, it doesn't like go on the fly.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So you still need a tool, but it should be very lightweight as well.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so that's where I define agent and skill.\nyusheng kuo: Now, how to create agent.\nyusheng kuo: So first of all, just give you a little bit.\nyusheng kuo: So I'm in cloud code now.\nyusheng kuo: Can you see my screen?\nAnsh Bindal: No, it's.\nAnsh Bindal: Screen went off.\nyusheng kuo: Damn it.\nyusheng kuo: I'm gonna like suffer this for the whole day.\nyusheng kuo: For five maybe.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So I'm in my cloud code, I'm using ghosteed.\nyusheng kuo: So the way you create agent is very simple, right?\nyusheng kuo: Is that you just describe it and you type slash agent.\nyusheng kuo: Then you will create a custom agent and you can just hit create new agent.\nyusheng kuo: You can see actually I create a different one here you can create a new agent say in project and generate with cloud and then you can start to describe it.\nyusheng kuo: For example, help me to create an agent to research code IQ and generate.\nyusheng kuo: One pager report for a given client.\nyusheng kuo: I will give it you, I will.\nyusheng kuo: Give you company name and domain for that.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so this is like a meta prompt, right?\nyusheng kuo: So you give it, you try to generate some prompts.\nyusheng kuo: But until today, this one way of generating agent is not very, how should I say, not very context aware.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, sorry, my kid broken.\nyusheng kuo: So there's where I actually.\nyusheng kuo: Let's go back.\nyusheng kuo: So this is just how you read, I would call it like a registering agent.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Go back to the Obsidian.\nyusheng kuo: So I actually I kind of like try to share.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: So I, I say there's a six principle of how to develop agent.\nyusheng kuo: So first is like you should try to develop by doing that, not by prompting that.\nyusheng kuo: So it's like, okay, for example, what do I mean by that?\nyusheng kuo: It's like when I'm doing this, right?\nyusheng kuo: Okay, I just continue whatever when I'm doing this.\nyusheng kuo: Enable.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: The reason I have this.\nyusheng kuo: So I create a new agent here I have a company one pager agent and you can view the agent.\nyusheng kuo: I was using prompt to create this one.\nyusheng kuo: I personally found this is not very reliable.\nyusheng kuo: It has some system prompt like your mission is doing this because it kind of guessing a lot of things.\nyusheng kuo: So what I found is more useful is called develop by doing that, not by prompting.\nyusheng kuo: So you try to actually step by step create this one pager showing you how to do that and then capture let agent.\nyusheng kuo: Like let cloud code capture the trace of what you've done and then summarize that.\nyusheng kuo: So he knows exactly how you are doing things, not just like you say how you do things.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So any step, any tool you touch, he would know that.\nyusheng kuo: So it's a better way to create the agent.\nyusheng kuo: So that's how I say you should develop.\nyusheng kuo: When I say develop an agent, it's like you try to do it once and showing agent, showing cloud code how you actually do it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, and then there's an important technique called context is your enemy, which is like you don't want to create a context continuously inline.\nyusheng kuo: And there's a technical recursive language model.\nyusheng kuo: So what does that do is actually, for example, let me give you a very vivid example.\nyusheng kuo: Say I have a tool in my data gen. Can you see my screen?\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: To pull my LinkedIn post.\nyusheng kuo: To pull all my LinkedIn posts.\nyusheng kuo: If I do this to it.\nyusheng kuo: So he will use my data mcp.\nyusheng kuo: We also create a the gateway.\nyusheng kuo: So he will basically search all the MCP that's in my gateway so it doesn't cramp up the token.\nyusheng kuo: See like everything I do here actually it will eventually become the chase for the agent.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So he finds this linking person post tool.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: You get LinkedIn person post tool require linking profile.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: I would say I'll just give you yours.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, I'll give you mine.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: So that's how.\nAnsh Bindal: This is good.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So I give you mine.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: He tried to execute the tool, but here's the thing.\nyusheng kuo: So when he execute this tool, he will blow up my contacts because I have so many post and then everything will just return back to the context window.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, let's take a look at that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so that share screen.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, sorry.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, sorry.\nyusheng kuo: See like, like see you got result because it exists.\nyusheng kuo: Maximum allow token.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Okay, let's stop it here because I have so many posts, right?\nyusheng kuo: How do you deal with that kind of situation?\nyusheng kuo: Like sometimes you have a transcript, right?\nyusheng kuo: It's like too big.\nyusheng kuo: You don't want to return.\nyusheng kuo: Now like a coco, even like a block you if you have like certain high token, but even like say like 1000 token, you don't want to like just blast it into your inline context.\nyusheng kuo: That's what I call inline context.\nyusheng kuo: Because every reply here actually would be fed into their contact space so you quickly blow up your.\nyusheng kuo: Your context window here he block it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So what do we do instead?\nyusheng kuo: So he actually tried to do it by create a.\nyusheng kuo: Either you use CLI tool or I get.\nyusheng kuo: You can use the data gen SDK we created SDK so you can basically any MCB tool can be used like a function in Python.\nyusheng kuo: Use data J SDK to save all.\nyusheng kuo: My posts in temp huge post.\nyusheng kuo: And let's see.\nyusheng kuo: So it doesn't.\nyusheng kuo: So that's where the recursive language model is like that.\nyusheng kuo: You let model to execute a code to save the context and then to save the.\nyusheng kuo: So he's trying to check if I have.\nyusheng kuo: That is my.\nyusheng kuo: Wait, am I in the right.\nyusheng kuo: Why is it like trying to create.\nyusheng kuo: A new virtual environment?\nyusheng kuo: But anyway he's trying to.\nyusheng kuo: Basically he's trying to write a code.\nyusheng kuo: My point is now he's trying to write a code to see.\nyusheng kuo: He's seeing like okay, so I download our data J SDK the cursor Also trying to do that by basically all the MCP become kind of a CLI tool.\nyusheng kuo: So he created a tool.\nyusheng kuo: He created a script to parse all the tool result the execute tour result the linking person post to result and then save it.\nyusheng kuo: So he only generated that part of the context.\nyusheng kuo: He doesn't directly get all the linking posts.\nyusheng kuo: That's especially useful if you are doing a long running task or you are handling a large 2 output.\nyusheng kuo: Now all my posts is in oppost JSON then I can actually ask if I have any question first I have a persistent storage now that all the posts I don't need to rely on agents context memory to remember my post.\nyusheng kuo: My agent can continue to revisit this.\nyusheng kuo: That's again why I feel by doing that it's much easier than prompted.\nyusheng kuo: So many details.\nyusheng kuo: I typically just do it once is a much faster way to develop the agent.\nyusheng kuo: And then using this type of context recursive language model you can try to look it up and in a context of like basically let agent write code to store their variable because now this file is your variable, right?\nyusheng kuo: It's old post JSON.\nyusheng kuo: I can say hey, find my post.\nyusheng kuo: About how to view agent.\nyusheng kuo: He would actually go into this JSON file try to search something.\nyusheng kuo: It's even better that yeah, he actually created individual markdown file.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, that's even better.\nyusheng kuo: Too many match.\nyusheng kuo: So he tried to use some kind of code right?\nyusheng kuo: He tried to use some kind of command line to search for build agent and he said okay, too many match.\nyusheng kuo: I try to Change.\nyusheng kuo: So you let agent self decide how to.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so like, like search your.\nyusheng kuo: Your post without bloating up your contacts here I have my contacts here.\nyusheng kuo: It's only 24%.\nyusheng kuo: So you see like he found this one, this one, this one, this one.\nyusheng kuo: So he only need to read this part.\nyusheng kuo: So that's the context is the enemy part.\nyusheng kuo: So.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, let's go to the fourth part is to make the model plan before you act.\nyusheng kuo: I should actually push it further.\nAnsh Bindal: But I do this all the time.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So I sometimes I could just go ahead and do things step by step.\nyusheng kuo: So I don't need like a plan.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Because sometimes the plan would just like make it.\nyusheng kuo: I feel like recently make it a brain rot.\nyusheng kuo: He would just try to stick to the plan too much.\nyusheng kuo: So here to make the model plan before you act is like, okay, I have the chase.\nyusheng kuo: Then I ask the model to wrap up and then create a plan to generate the agent.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And then.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's like.\nyusheng kuo: It's very helpful.\nyusheng kuo: And then like they can generate a task that.\nyusheng kuo: Let me see.\nyusheng kuo: So all the documentation I'll share with you later on.\nyusheng kuo: We have only three more minutes.\nyusheng kuo: That's finally validated with hook, not hook.\nyusheng kuo: So if your output is a structured output, right.\nyusheng kuo: You should ask the model to write a hook to validate them before finalizing the output.\nyusheng kuo: For example, today you do a deep research.\nyusheng kuo: You can actually create a structured JSON like output JSON.\nyusheng kuo: Say at the end of this research, you should have company, company name reasoning, interesting thing, something.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And then you write a hook.\nyusheng kuo: You just ask to write a hook to make sure you actually validate the output of your.\nyusheng kuo: So you might actually create an output of like, like a deep research JSON.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And then your hook actually would validate this JSON file output.\nyusheng kuo: And then if it failed, this is how the RALPH thing kind of doing.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: If it failed, it would just continue to generate until it finished the job.\nyusheng kuo: So you don't rely on like this cohort, right.\nyusheng kuo: You don't just rely on agent to do it.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: You actually create a hook to force it to be right.\nyusheng kuo: It could also be used as a guardrail.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So that's like.\nyusheng kuo: And then finally it's like your product should not be like monolithic context.\nyusheng kuo: Sorry, monolithic code.\nyusheng kuo: Like with a workflow, your product is actually encoding expertise.\nyusheng kuo: Like your skill set, your MCP tools, your context eventually become the product or this software.\nyusheng kuo: So that's in the end, like what I mean like agent os.\nyusheng kuo: So we can only touch on here.\nyusheng kuo: I don't have time to touch on build and deploy.\nyusheng kuo: So basically okay you have the agent.\nyusheng kuo: So here I think I give you an example.\nyusheng kuo: Here is like I tried to create.\nyusheng kuo: Here's a script based output.\nyusheng kuo: Here's a more of a detail of how the things work.\nyusheng kuo: I use cloud code to write it so it might not be super accurate but I try to create a personalized PDF one page of factory for you.\nyusheng kuo: We can try to.\nyusheng kuo: If you have another time we can try to go it but basically say like okay now you create an agent that's every time the newly coming in you can create.\nyusheng kuo: Let me see if I have it here.\nyusheng kuo: Like here is an example, right?\nyusheng kuo: Like the co iq there's a. I just grabbed from your company's websites like a case study, right?\nyusheng kuo: I think you say okay capture or like case by secure.\nyusheng kuo: So you see like he he although he already kind of know what they might care of course I'm not an expert of it so it's you you should prep your contact to.\nyusheng kuo: To frame it really well.\nyusheng kuo: But he already kind of know like for this guy what I care is about like Chase show, right?\nyusheng kuo: It's like that's a different topic line, different type of opportunity, different type of like lead list.\nyusheng kuo: So it's very adaptive.\nyusheng kuo: And then if you deploy this agent like you don't need to create that, you just need to update like basically he will send out this report to your email, right and let you review and if you say yeah agree and then you can send to the customer.\nyusheng kuo: You don't need to like go into cloud code every time and then try to like manage them like a one by one for each lead and it's better than Clay because he actually can get a lot of contacts and it's much easier to develop, right because you just tell whenever you don't like it you just tell the agent to update that and then you have much more wider access of API MCP compared to Clay.\nyusheng kuo: So I think those are kind of high level thing.\nyusheng kuo: I recommend you do it in cloud code and it deploys the agent so you can be integrated into your system.\nyusheng kuo: So that's what agent look like.\nyusheng kuo: So the agent look like on our website is like I created this coiq open agent, right?\nyusheng kuo: So you just have this webhook so you can just let it run or like schedule it or you can just give this web host to whatever like a Clay, right?\nyusheng kuo: So Clay prepare some kind of context of this company and send to this webhook.\nyusheng kuo: Eventually you can think of like nan blend it into A clay, but it's like cloud code blending into your clay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, interesting.\nAnsh Bindal: Can I schedule a follow up with you and like in a week or two, like I'll play around with this, dive deeper and then I might have more questions and I saw your website.\nAnsh Bindal: You have like a discord channel.\nAnsh Bindal: I'll join that as well.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then just I will send you this repository.\nyusheng kuo: There are two skill I already created and then you can try to follow it.\nyusheng kuo: Where are you?\nyusheng kuo: Okay, wait, wait, do I.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, I probably already.\nyusheng kuo: But so one final thing.\nyusheng kuo: Sorry to rush through because like I.\nyusheng kuo: Got a hot limit.\nyusheng kuo: But here's two skill you can see.\nyusheng kuo: It's like one is called how to create Agent and the other called how to deploy Agent.\nyusheng kuo: So if you open this repository in your cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: So that's why I feel like cloud code is actually the operating system.\nyusheng kuo: This wouldn't mean anything unless you open cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: But if you open cloud code like Kauko will read this and then help you to create an agent and deploy agent.\nyusheng kuo: And then I try to embed my understanding of how to create Agent into this skill.\nyusheng kuo: So he will try to guide you step by step.\nyusheng kuo: Let me send you this repository and.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, let's get into it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, okay.\nyusheng kuo: I hope it's helpful.\nyusheng kuo: Like it's very short.\nyusheng kuo: 30 minutes.\nAnsh Bindal: Yeah, thank you so much.\nAnsh Bindal: Bye.\nTitle: 30 Min Meeting between Yusheng Kuo and Ansh Bindal\nHost Email: yusheng.kuo@datagen.dev\nOrganizer Email: yusheng.kuo@datagen.dev\nCalendar Id: tkMiiWiFg1DejWAcphTdfF@Cal.com\nFireflies Users: yusheng.kuo@datagen.dev, ansh.bindal1996@gmail.com\nParticipants: ansh.bindal1996@gmail.com,yusheng.kuo@datagen.dev, ansh.bindal1996@gmail.com\nDate: 1771349400000\nTranscript Url: https://app.fireflies.ai/view/01KHP2EJMV96HDCD71P35DMDTT\nAudio Url: https://cdn.fireflies.ai/01KHP2EJMV96HDCD71P35DMDTT/audio.mp3?Expires=1771567418&Policy=eyJTdGF0ZW1lbnQiOlt7IlJlc291cmNlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9jZG4uZmlyZWZsaWVzLmFpLzAxS0hQMkVKTVY5NkhEQ0Q3MVAzNURNRFRUL2F1ZGlvLm1wMyIsIkNvbmRpdGlvbiI6eyJEYXRlTGVzc1RoYW4iOnsiQVdTOkVwb2NoVGltZSI6MTc3MTU2NzQxOH19fV19&Signature=JQLrjzzsUdNAyR9LC0hMg45M30sn2MvkUoIuaa6ZVd1jrVBIABJvPHiKjTSYP2MRGCjCfU27B8Ags6dEnW5~J-6k3g9fgGjP8URj7lDANYz9YmMYgFolNVjgJLWlidxBTMUj5B4164U0Eci5NgzAFwnk9h3gxl2Zq0-A-wfvkG8sq1~yOStj04GOwBPY7p1i5YdfCfp41L~NJOU5ZN4~vCDRrPae-~JR3qzkWGMwfS1y8dVdt6ern8pwf0pkWZjK5ImIFZf6eyM9JRO63-tJ2ZiBtmixGEZhB6UhzojKP0FS3Zgak1gUTZ2j66A3YxIhVZvk9aWyrpibixX~PdukiQ__&Key-Pair-Id=K25ZJR0UZVF4CM\nVideo Url: No video url\nDuration: 32.189998626708984\nMeeting Attendees: ansh.bindal1996@gmail.com, yusheng.kuo@datagen.dev\nCal Id: _ehlkqqb9atkkcpph8himklq1cdo6gl34cp340gr1dgn66rrd\nCalendar Type: google\nMeeting Link: https://meet.google.com/abp-sjfb-wjz"
