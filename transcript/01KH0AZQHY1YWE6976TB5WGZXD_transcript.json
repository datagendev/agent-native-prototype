I think that data gen could do a better job with.\nJeremy Ross: With the dossier stuff, but I'm not sure if.\nJeremy Ross: If it's worth putting that time into considering when they need this done by.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nJeremy Ross: And so.\nJeremy Ross: All right, so one thing was the reports and then the other thing was.\nJeremy Ross: Sorry, I'm still a little bit foggy.\nyusheng kuo: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Sorry for that.\nJeremy Ross: No, no, give me.\nJeremy Ross: Give me a second.\nyusheng kuo: Did you think.\nyusheng kuo: Did you go see any doctor or.\nJeremy Ross: No.\nyusheng kuo: Like they recover.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: No.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Food is not.\nyusheng kuo: The food is no joke.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, no, it could beat people down.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Dude, it totally wrecked me.\nJeremy Ross: Really.\nJeremy Ross: Okay, so.\nyusheng kuo: Me.\nJeremy Ross: Let me think for a second.\nJeremy Ross: Maybe you can talk me through it.\nJeremy Ross: So there was a reports, there was a dossiers.\nyusheng kuo: So currently dossier is generating from clay.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And it's triggered by your like you have a schedule run right.\nyusheng kuo: To continue to enrich and find the 10 right on clay side.\nJeremy Ross: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: And the dossier will first be reading into Google Doc and they will review it.\nyusheng kuo: Also you want it to be like imported into hotspot.\nyusheng kuo: Is that correct?\nJeremy Ross: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then what we can do like the minimal thing is we be able to.\nyusheng kuo: What I can think of is like first we can have the like our email agent to kind of just massage it over report and send to the.\nyusheng kuo: The rep and then rap can like question like compare.\nyusheng kuo: The first question I have probably is like okay, would this report be like the.\nyusheng kuo: The total like all the prospect that should contact type of report or like per contact report.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, because I feel like they.\nyusheng kuo: What they want is probably like okay, what I need to do today.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Type of a report.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Okay that's okay.\nJeremy Ross: So that reminds me, what I was going to say was originally they wanted the.\nJeremy Ross: The like you know the trickle.\nJeremy Ross: The trickle out lead thing right where I don't even know how to describe it.\nyusheng kuo: But yeah, it's just like continue to like info of like pipe gen.\nJeremy Ross: Almost like like yeah, like from this bucket.\nJeremy Ross: And then they were like ah, never mind.\nJeremy Ross: So I'm like Okay.\nJeremy Ross: That was going to be like one of the main use cases for Data Gen.\nJeremy Ross: I think the last one is just like we could do the dossier through Datagen.\nJeremy Ross: Maybe not enough time, but the report, the reports, I think that that would be pretty awesome and I think it would be easy enough to put together.\nJeremy Ross: Like, did you look at the ones that I made so far?\nyusheng kuo: The dossier?\nJeremy Ross: No, not for the dossier, but for the repo spot.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, in the repo, the HubSpot reports that I have there.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, to the.\nyusheng kuo: The one you created before or today?\nJeremy Ross: No, so just several days ago.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So there's like a high level manager type of a report, right?\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, but it's, it's important to have some that are on the rep level as well.\nJeremy Ross: And I did want to like sync with you on this and understand like what, what technical issues might we come across if we tried to roll this out with their team?\nJeremy Ross: So they have about maybe eight AES and do you think that it would be possible to have something like this set up where like they each get a report and this report could be that like in a way it's saying like this is.\nJeremy Ross: These are some things that you should pay attention to today.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, but I mean, based on the hotspot.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, I mean it could be weekly too, but it's.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, I just wanted to understand like if it's possible today.\nyusheng kuo: No, yeah, I think let's do it now.\nyusheng kuo: Like, is it possible?\nyusheng kuo: I think like say you want to do it because like you have API, right?\nyusheng kuo: You want to turn out.\nyusheng kuo: Let's first.\nyusheng kuo: The way I do this is like, let's first one rep and then let cloud code like come in.\nyusheng kuo: Use the API hotspot to pull some interesting data together and then we can have a rough idea of how that report should look like.\nyusheng kuo: I think you have that kind of taste to know what's useful, what's not.\nyusheng kuo: I don't have that kind of taste, but I can kind of guide through like, okay, this is like the process.\nyusheng kuo: So I don't know if you can kind of open the cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: Let's find a wrap, because once we have one wrap, like kind of working, we can ask cloud code to summarize how it does this and then just let it deploy as an agent quickly.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's try.\nyusheng kuo: That isn't just one report.\nyusheng kuo: You just kind of like the ad hoc.\nyusheng kuo: Try to create, create a report for one rep.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know what the hotspot look like.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, you probably already have an idea of what the.\nyusheng kuo: Because that's how you kind of.\nyusheng kuo: So don't worry about using like custom tool anything.\nyusheng kuo: Just let it kind of grind and then let it take over.\nJeremy Ross: Here, let me.\nJeremy Ross: I'll just share my screen.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, that'll probably be easier.\nyusheng kuo: I will take care of the deploy bar.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's actually pretty easy once you, once you know, like once you create a kind of agent prompt.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: So do you have like.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, let's first set up something like.\nyusheng kuo: Let's have like a Python for example.\nyusheng kuo: Make sure you have.\nyusheng kuo: Let's do slash.\nyusheng kuo: You probably, you probably need to go to terminal.\nJeremy Ross: Wait, should I like merge your stuff or update?\nyusheng kuo: No, no, no, it's okay.\nyusheng kuo: Don't worry.\nyusheng kuo: You don't need to.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's not necessary.\nyusheng kuo: So you just go to, you just open cloud code like in terminal.\nyusheng kuo: You probably have to open in terminal to use the.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, just try to install.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Coaud.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Then slash, install data Gen. Python.\nyusheng kuo: I think you're familiar with Python.\nyusheng kuo: Not familiar with.\nyusheng kuo: But you have Python locally, right?\nyusheng kuo: So you just choose the third one.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, we will create a virtual environment here.\nyusheng kuo: You just can just follow me.\nyusheng kuo: You don't need to hold all the details.\nyusheng kuo: So basically what this do is making sure you have a Python library that's created here that will be used later on.\nyusheng kuo: So you don't have data gen. Oh no, you have.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: And you say yes.\nyusheng kuo: So this would create a Python.\nyusheng kuo: Make sure you have everything installed but later on you actually can create a script to do things.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: So this is a one time setup.\nyusheng kuo: So go.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: So this is trying to install SDK.\nyusheng kuo: Yes, it's trying to test.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Now you will try to update.\nJeremy Ross: It's interesting.\nJeremy Ross: I thought I did this already.\nyusheng kuo: Oh no, it will be per project.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Because sometimes it could be.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I, I, we.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, different project.\nyusheng kuo: You might want to add it.\nyusheng kuo: You probably don't.\nyusheng kuo: So it's per project.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's not per user level.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Because you don't have Agent IMD so you know they start to have the memory thing.\nyusheng kuo: It's insane.\nyusheng kuo: It's just so fast.\nyusheng kuo: It's like, you know, there's a, there's an article from the author of Beat.\nyusheng kuo: He's actually a principal engineer.\nyusheng kuo: Was, he was a principal engineer in Google and now he's working like kind of side project with Amp.\nyusheng kuo: Amp.\nyusheng kuo: It's a pretty nice like coding agent and he interviewed actually 40 like anthropic engineer and they say like he feel like they will become Google.\nyusheng kuo: It's just like the, the talent density there.\nJeremy Ross: Wow, that's cool.\nyusheng kuo: And then the way they move is like Google they don't have like they say they call it like a hype mind.\nyusheng kuo: Like everyone feel the same mission.\nyusheng kuo: You know like, like Gemini have a lot of like executing left right and then like OpenAI almost all the co founder left except bgd bregman but like anthropi have all 7 co founders still there.\nyusheng kuo: It's like they have such a strong.\nyusheng kuo: And then they say like they are so like enthusiastic like so.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And say they feel like it's like an NFL like for.\nyusheng kuo: For.\nyusheng kuo: For the, for the.\nyusheng kuo: For this type of AI thing.\nyusheng kuo: Like the talent is so high and yeah, it's like I feel like they're moving in the same past pace.\nyusheng kuo: Like they only spend 10 days to create cowork.\nyusheng kuo: But I have to say I feel their quality is not as good.\nyusheng kuo: OpenAI.\nyusheng kuo: OpenAI still have way better like engineering quality.\nyusheng kuo: I was a QA in terms of what things are being put out but you can feel like the cloud code is like hugely fast machine.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, now we have this then.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, you have everything here.\nyusheng kuo: So now cloud MD would know it.\nyusheng kuo: So let's go ask.\nyusheng kuo: Do you have like your API key of hotspot here?\nJeremy Ross: No, but it's in datagen.\nyusheng kuo: Oh okay.\nJeremy Ross: Added as a secret.\nyusheng kuo: I see.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Then we can do that that way too.\nyusheng kuo: So let's do this like let's.\nyusheng kuo: Because that will be faster just to develop everything here because I can kind of see everything.\nyusheng kuo: Let's do you do.\nyusheng kuo: Did you see the, the.\nyusheng kuo: The small like kind of like a split thing next to the trash box on the terminal that will actually let you.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Split the.\nyusheng kuo: The one that split.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So that on the right we can have the terminal.\nyusheng kuo: So touch T O u c h space touch space.in so we can.\nyusheng kuo: You have to have a.in yeah so let's try to have a local like thing so we can have very fast development.\nyusheng kuo: So this is actually how most like software they share their in and then you can actually open the.in and let's try to store the husband API key here locally.\nyusheng kuo: Later on we will do git ignore so it doesn't actually get pushed.\nyusheng kuo: So this API key doesn't get pushed.\nyusheng kuo: So you can create an API key, save the API key.\nJeremy Ross: Then how do we make sure that this doesn't get pushed?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so let's do it now.\nyusheng kuo: On the cloud you say make sure.in is git, ignore and git before you come in.\nyusheng kuo: So you will update your git ignore and you can see how to do it.\nyusheng kuo: It's ignore and git.\nyusheng kuo: It will ask you to do things.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so now you.\nyusheng kuo: You see that actually it added that.\nJeremy Ross: It added the virtual environment as well.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Because you don't need the VM feeder.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: And yeah, your status is pretty safe one.\nyusheng kuo: You just check your status.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, Now let's save the API key here so we can.\nyusheng kuo: This is for the sake of like a moving fast.\nyusheng kuo: So we can actually.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I actually feel.\nyusheng kuo: My.\nyusheng kuo: My honest feeling is like unless you deploying the custom tool right.\nyusheng kuo: You.\nyusheng kuo: You actually can.\nyusheng kuo: Let cloud code do a lot of local script with skill and using MCP to connect to the external source.\nyusheng kuo: Because I don't like using API key to connect to the data source.\nyusheng kuo: Technically it's not quite safe.\nyusheng kuo: But let's try to do it here first.\nyusheng kuo: Try to get a sense and then we can create a custom tool later on.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, just add that API key to dot ink.\nyusheng kuo: The.\nyusheng kuo: It will be the.\nyusheng kuo: The format is the like hotspot AP_API key equal your value.\nJeremy Ross: Wait, wait.\nJeremy Ross: Sorry, give me.\nJeremy Ross: Give me a second.\nJeremy Ross: I was juggling something trying to log into HubSpot to get the API key.\nJeremy Ross: 1 second.\nyusheng kuo: It.\nJeremy Ross: Almost there.\nJeremy Ross: Bear with me.\nyusheng kuo: Go to die in.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: I mean I'm still.\nJeremy Ross: I'm like juggling HubSpot still.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: What do you want me to do in the end?\nJeremy Ross: You want me to.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, just a hotspot_ api_ key and later on you can put it here.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, So that's like one time set up.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Second and if you use the same secret in data generate.\nyusheng kuo: So that secret actually can also that you use in your like later on your agent environment.\nyusheng kuo: So like everything you did here actually the agent could do remote.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So just make sure it's using the same name.\nJeremy Ross: Oh, like the API.\nJeremy Ross: Oh, okay.\nJeremy Ross: I don't know what it is because it doesn't show it in the UI on datagen.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, you just go to SAS secrete.\nJeremy Ross: No, I mean it doesn't show what the actual.\nJeremy Ross: Oh.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, okay.\nyusheng kuo: Then you can actually go to just slash and you just say hey, can you show all the secret in data gen?\nyusheng kuo: Show secret in data gen.\nyusheng kuo: It will show you the name.\nJeremy Ross: Wait, what is this push to origin stuff?\nJeremy Ross: Where in the terminal on the left side.\nyusheng kuo: Push to.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, it's the push to remote.\nyusheng kuo: So it will push to your repo.\nyusheng kuo: We can't.\nyusheng kuo: We can let you do it later.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it.\nyusheng kuo: Just push.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, just save to the cloud.\nyusheng kuo: Save to GitHub.\nJeremy Ross: So to GitHub.\nyusheng kuo: Yes, push it.\nyusheng kuo: Exactly.\nyusheng kuo: That's what you suggest.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Yes, Push it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Also show me.\nyusheng kuo: Data Gen Secrets.\nyusheng kuo: There's a.\nyusheng kuo: The tool in data gen. Actually.\nJeremy Ross: 16 secrets.\nJeremy Ross: Look how much I trust you guys.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: We treat it seriously.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nJeremy Ross: All right.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so we get.\nJeremy Ross: That's weird.\nJeremy Ross: How'd that end up as OpenAI?\nyusheng kuo: It's okay.\nyusheng kuo: It's like it's just an attack.\nyusheng kuo: It doesn't matter.\nyusheng kuo: But.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, that's ironic, isn't it?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, now.\nJeremy Ross: I need to figure out where the hell is this API key.\nJeremy Ross: Oh, might have it.\nJeremy Ross: Access.\nJeremy Ross: Okay, so there are two things.\nJeremy Ross: I can't remember which one I chose, but in HubSpot there's an access token and a client secret.\nJeremy Ross: Oh, wait, so use.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: Access token is used to make API calls.\nJeremy Ross: Client secret is used for signature validation.\nJeremy Ross: So it's definitely access token.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: All right, that didn't work.\nJeremy Ross: There we go.\nyusheng kuo: All right, cool.\nJeremy Ross: We're good, man.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, let's go then.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know what question.\nyusheng kuo: What do you probably want to do?\nyusheng kuo: Like.\nJeremy Ross: So the reason why we did all that SDK stuff and like setting.\nyusheng kuo: Up the API key.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: So this is so that we can iterate here.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: And not iterate on datagen.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: And then we can just take the final code of whatever we make and say deploy this to datagen.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: If you want to be like fixed workflow, there were one way or you wanted to be like an agent.\nyusheng kuo: We can do like an agent way.\nyusheng kuo: So we become like a skill for the agent to use it.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I will show you along the way and then I would show you like the good and bad.\nyusheng kuo: But let's first just try to let it explore.\nyusheng kuo: Like, let's go to one, maybe one wrap.\nyusheng kuo: Like, maybe you can describe what kind of report you want to do and let actually cloud code three, four, if.\nJeremy Ross: That'S possible to say.\nJeremy Ross: Well, who had the most account conversations?\nJeremy Ross: Was that.\nJeremy Ross: That was something you added, right?\nyusheng kuo: I think so.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's okay.\nyusheng kuo: You can say, hey, amount of sales rep here.\nyusheng kuo: Can you go to Hotspot and see who had the most compensation?\nyusheng kuo: Tell me how we gonna do it.\nyusheng kuo: You can in play modeface.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: You have my.\nyusheng kuo: And then you say you have my API key.\nyusheng kuo: Dying Hotspot API key.\nyusheng kuo: No, not Eddie Automatically like one step further.\nJeremy Ross: What I just left.\nyusheng kuo: Let's do plan mode because that would be more.\nyusheng kuo: It's not just like it's.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's not just.\nyusheng kuo: It's only read but you will be more thorough.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah okay.\nJeremy Ross: Sure.\nyusheng kuo: And you can say the.\nyusheng kuo: The name of the sales rep is in sales.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: You probably have a whisper flow or something like super whisper to do.\nJeremy Ross: I wish.\nJeremy Ross: I mean I. I do.\nJeremy Ross: I just.\nJeremy Ross: I think it's.\nJeremy Ross: Anyways.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Just go ahead.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Do you know if there's an existing hot spot skill like somewhere.\nJeremy Ross: I don't know.\nyusheng kuo: Maybe.\nyusheng kuo: Maybe there would be.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, I was trying to make one.\nJeremy Ross: That's what my hook is for.\nyusheng kuo: Let me see.\nJeremy Ross: Wait.\nJeremy Ross: Where.\nyusheng kuo: If it's there then yeah they might actually find.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah I think they found it like a resource actually.\nJeremy Ross: Well I'm just saying like this.\nJeremy Ross: I made this so that I can like absorb knowledge about how HubSpot works and then it should add it to Claude.\nJeremy Ross: So like whenever things about HubSpot then Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah he already see some resource.\nyusheng kuo: I saw that.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: So it seems like it's doing something.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: You go back to the cloud.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: This one review.\nyusheng kuo: Wait, so what is he plan find salesperson with most conversation hotspot.\nyusheng kuo: So he would use the online existing sales that JSON Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Approach.\nyusheng kuo: He will use this API called calls and emails query that app owner ID to names.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Put it down return result so the highest.\nyusheng kuo: This is what you're going to do.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Go down.\nyusheng kuo: It's just an API call for everyone you call in the CRM.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Three only common ID mapping is required.\nyusheng kuo: You say don't don't use execute in datagen just do it locally.\nyusheng kuo: Say don't use execute code.\nyusheng kuo: It will be faster to like iterate.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I now actually exclusively use their local code execution because now like we are using SDK so they have a very good parity.\nyusheng kuo: We use execute code for like client doesn't have it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: The code code environment.\nyusheng kuo: Coding environment.\nyusheng kuo: It'll be faster.\nJeremy Ross: Mm.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's right.\nyusheng kuo: You say.\nyusheng kuo: You say it's in dying.\nJeremy Ross: What?\nyusheng kuo: Say it's Go to down.\nyusheng kuo: Just to click down.\nJeremy Ross: Click down.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: Go to other.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Other say it's in dying.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah say it's in dying.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: You're gonna manually approve that if you worry.\nJeremy Ross: I'm not worried.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's actually pretty good.\nyusheng kuo: Now this is like super simple thing but then too yeah yeah.\nyusheng kuo: The only thing we can let it grind here but I will actually recommend later on there's A thing in Cloudime you can say like save all your intermediate steps like output to tmp.\nyusheng kuo: So the benefit of it is actually when they query the result, it's not just directly put into the contact window.\nyusheng kuo: They actually save it as a file and then later on the agent can read the file so it becomes like a persistent memory.\nyusheng kuo: And they can, they don't like they read it on demand.\nJeremy Ross: Where does it.\nJeremy Ross: So how does it know which TMP file to look at since it's just.\nyusheng kuo: They will just search.\nyusheng kuo: They will just figure it out.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Because they will first do a list of the TMP because they know they actually in your skill or like in your cloud md say it's in gmp.\nyusheng kuo: So they will actually try to LS it And then because they typically would name the file in a way that's obvious.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So that's a trick like a tip or like when you have a very long running task.\nyusheng kuo: Like in my case like a 40 for example.\nyusheng kuo: I have this kind of 14 step.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And that would like greatly reduce the chance they will actually me round like running out of the context and have to compact.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, that's smart.\nyusheng kuo: And that's how Manus actually I know they kind of hard coded that but I really feel Calco become like the only agent firmware unique because nowadays they just make this.\nyusheng kuo: They just have all the required thing for, for the agent.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Wow.\nyusheng kuo: Really?\nyusheng kuo: He had like 7,000 total engagement.\nyusheng kuo: Do you want to break down like call and conversation meeting so you can break it down?\nJeremy Ross: Oh, what I think I'll do.\nJeremy Ross: Let's, let's make, let's focus on what a rep would want to know.\nJeremy Ross: So.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: I'm gonna just tell it like act like a seasoned sales rep. Sure, sure.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, let's do it.\nyusheng kuo: Let's do it.\nyusheng kuo: See how he goes.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then, and then, and then, and then based on the hostile data.\nyusheng kuo: What?\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Let's see.\nyusheng kuo: I, I want to know because you are seasoned sales rep.\nyusheng kuo: So you can kind of tell us.\nJeremy Ross: Let's see.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, we probably really need a free whisper flow.\nyusheng kuo: I heard actually like Microsoft has a free one like no API key even you can just like talk to it.\nJeremy Ross: Oh lucky.\nyusheng kuo: Because of course you, you, you give up your, your voice like whatever.\nyusheng kuo: But I think it's free.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: How's that sound?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, just the composition of data.\nyusheng kuo: Do you.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, okay.\nyusheng kuo: You say.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, I didn't hear you there at the end.\nJeremy Ross: Was that.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, oh.\nyusheng kuo: I say it will be a conversation.\nyusheng kuo: All data and others.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: All right, let's see.\nyusheng kuo: So typically, does hotspot have like a meeting data there?\nyusheng kuo: Like a meeting conversation, anything, or just.\nJeremy Ross: I mean, it's not like transcript.\nJeremy Ross: No.\nJeremy Ross: I mean, it could, but it's not out of the box like that.\nyusheng kuo: No.\nJeremy Ross: Okay, but let's see what we got here.\nyusheng kuo: Do you know why audio is good?\nyusheng kuo: Like why people are using audio?\nJeremy Ross: Adio.\nyusheng kuo: This seems like a writing song.\nJeremy Ross: It just seem.\nJeremy Ross: It's like a.\nJeremy Ross: A little bit more flexible than other serums and like cheaper and stuff.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, probably cheaper.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: A nicer ui.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, I mean it's.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: HubSpot tends to nickel and dime people, so.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, but like everyone's saying like assassin's like really in trouble.\nyusheng kuo: We'll see.\nJeremy Ross: We will see, man.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, I feel like the future is headless, at least.\nyusheng kuo: For sure.\nyusheng kuo: For sure.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I even thinking, how do we actually let agent just directly sign up and do things without human in the loop, like using us from the sign up?\nyusheng kuo: I know it sounds a bit crazy, but I just feel like this actually probably should be the right way for this.\nyusheng kuo: We should be like the first thing.\nyusheng kuo: Agent tried to add MCP to actually try to suggest this.\nyusheng kuo: And then they try to deploy.\nyusheng kuo: They will say, hey, you can use cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: Because if you.\nyusheng kuo: If you.\nyusheng kuo: If you search online, like Google Cloud, like a how to deploy cloud code agent, you basically don't see anything.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I actually, I. I don't know.\nyusheng kuo: I noticed like, I revamped the.\nyusheng kuo: The landing page.\nJeremy Ross: No, I didn't.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, but it's okay.\nyusheng kuo: It's later.\nyusheng kuo: What do you think about this?\nyusheng kuo: Like, how do we.\nJeremy Ross: Oh, excuse me.\nJeremy Ross: I don't know if you could hear that.\nJeremy Ross: It's just like my head just exploded.\nyusheng kuo: No, no, I didn't.\nJeremy Ross: I think that there's some pretty good sound cancellation.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, I.\nJeremy Ross: Oh, buddy.\nJeremy Ross: Let me just skim through this real quick.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, take your time.\nJeremy Ross: I'll just say build all of them.\nJeremy Ross: Let's see what happens.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, you can say just use one of them to test so it doesn't go crazy for all the people.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, these things are just target for one rep. Like who has the most data.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, let me see.\nJeremy Ross: Who was that?\nyusheng kuo: So we can kind of get an idea of a concrete example of that.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, now because it might actually have a lot of data.\nyusheng kuo: Let's stop it.\nJeremy Ross: You said stop it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, stop it, stop it.\nyusheng kuo: Now save the intermediate.\nyusheng kuo: Usually save the intermediate data to temp, slash temp if needed.\nyusheng kuo: So you don't go like, you don't.\nyusheng kuo: You don't go get cramped up to the token too fast.\nyusheng kuo: So save the intermediate data output to.\nyusheng kuo: To temp or.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, to just temp tmp.\nyusheng kuo: They will figure out where to put.\nyusheng kuo: No, no, no need.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, just tmp.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, just tmp.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: To tab folder and so you don't get crammed up too soon.\nyusheng kuo: It's lowercase, but yeah, it's fine.\nyusheng kuo: I will see.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, he actually still created TMP lowercase.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, good.\nyusheng kuo: Did you see the mkdir?\nyusheng kuo: That's actually.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, you can say yes.\nyusheng kuo: So you see, he created a Codex/temp/Taylor Howie report.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: That's where the.\nyusheng kuo: The temp will go.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nJeremy Ross: So what?\nyusheng kuo: Wait, he said.\nyusheng kuo: He said no deal.\nyusheng kuo: Huh.\nyusheng kuo: So he's just really good at talking anyway.\nyusheng kuo: Like is that real?\nJeremy Ross: Wait, Project codex temp.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: There's nothing in it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, let's let it go.\nyusheng kuo: Well, is it.\nyusheng kuo: Is that possible today?\nyusheng kuo: Where did they save the deal?\nJeremy Ross: Oh, it says Taylor has no deals.\nyusheng kuo: Why is the she.\nJeremy Ross: Taylor can be male or female.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I know but like why?\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, it shows.\nJeremy Ross: It made that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: And it's put down.\nJeremy Ross: No deal Taylor.\nJeremy Ross: Oh, duh.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, Taylor.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: Taylor is a bdr.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, okay.\nJeremy Ross: Who's not a bdr?\nJeremy Ross: Maybe James.\nyusheng kuo: You can ask him.\nyusheng kuo: Like whoever have deal.\nyusheng kuo: Can just stop it anyway.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Find one who has most deal.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, I.\nyusheng kuo: Whichever I can.\nyusheng kuo: So BDR doesn't handle deal.\nyusheng kuo: They only do outreach.\nyusheng kuo: Is that how it works?\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, they set the meeting for the ae.\nyusheng kuo: I see.\nyusheng kuo: But I heard from another A say like now they want the AE to handle pipe gen as well.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Is it common now?\nJeremy Ross: I've seen that more and more where they tell them tell the a cycle.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: And then it's like well, how does anyone break into sales and if there's no entry level role?\nJeremy Ross: So that's one of the issues.\nyusheng kuo: Wow.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: So, all right, we'll definitely do James.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: We'll make James happy and James have the most deal.\nyusheng kuo: Then orgy will be happy.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Actually, I think they will figure it out.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But yeah, go ahead.\nJeremy Ross: Why not?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Just give it a little bit of a notch.\nyusheng kuo: I feel like after like it's.\nyusheng kuo: It's really become a skill like working with AI at least ll and who knows what will be the next gen AI.\nyusheng kuo: Like I now start to like always like try to create context as much as possible.\nyusheng kuo: Like doing a lot of planning ahead of time.\nyusheng kuo: And it turned out it's like not very human way to like create things or like a like prompt yeah.\nyusheng kuo: That become kind of a superpower almost.\nyusheng kuo: Like I can like easily create things like agents super fast, but like just not that straightforward for all this.\nyusheng kuo: No.\nyusheng kuo: At least right now.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Wait, so okay, how did we get this to appear so quickly?\nyusheng kuo: Oh, because it's, it's, it's API call.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, yeah, but I mean like, okay, so it made a temp folder.\nJeremy Ross: But there's nothing special about a temp folder.\nJeremy Ross: It's just, it's a folder.\nJeremy Ross: It just, it's called tmp.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's just kind of an intermediate thing.\nyusheng kuo: So like just the AI would try to like go crazy to first populate all the data and later on to read it.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: So just try to fetch first.\nyusheng kuo: So you did it.\nyusheng kuo: This is like so good.\nyusheng kuo: This is actually the best feature I see.\nyusheng kuo: Make this agent really a complete platform because they basically can help you to do workflow, like agentic workflow.\nyusheng kuo: And then one of the things always kind of missing before is like the dependency graph, like after you feed 1, 2, 3 and then when you do 4, 5.\nyusheng kuo: Do you remember this is why we try to use B?\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And now they're just built in.\nyusheng kuo: They actually say they are inspired by B, so it's the same thing.\nyusheng kuo: And then now you can each of them actually have a common memory.\nyusheng kuo: So it's like you really don't need any other agent.\nyusheng kuo: Like a LangChain, like act.\nyusheng kuo: No even ladder.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like all these different frameworks, like they just like, why do I need it?\nyusheng kuo: I can just create agent here like with really high efficiency.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And the interesting thing is like, you know when, before, when I do this kind of workflow, I need to build in a lot of a retry something right now I don't even need to because like if it fail, it's.\nyusheng kuo: It will wait and it will try something like for example, if I like 500 query, two of them fail, you only redo that, two fail.\nyusheng kuo: This is like a more adaptive retry, like an intelligent retry.\nyusheng kuo: Before I have to write like a very fixed rule like retry after exponential something, do something.\nyusheng kuo: But now it's like this is much better.\nyusheng kuo: What's it called?\nyusheng kuo: Like reliability.\nyusheng kuo: Because now it doesn't only use the very mechanical way to rerun the API call.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, the world is changing.\nJeremy Ross: It is the software, it's moving way too fast for me.\nyusheng kuo: I really don't.\nyusheng kuo: I really think whoever think like the MIT report is, I think it's kind of the best.\nyusheng kuo: I think NDROPI is really putting out something like it's just the pace, like things moving so fast.\nyusheng kuo: Like only one year ago I couldn't really create like even the whole data JS premise early on.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Last year was oh because AI couldn't do like a long running task.\nyusheng kuo: So we need to actually wrap it into like a workflow.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: For AI as a tool.\nyusheng kuo: But turn out it becomes skill.\nyusheng kuo: Do you remember I say like agent need to create its own tool to make it more powerful and we were betting on tool, but that becomes skill.\nyusheng kuo: Like nowadays like an agent would just continue to create its own skill.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So that's something I think we bet wrong.\nyusheng kuo: Tool is still important because tool have some kind of important property.\nyusheng kuo: But that wouldn't be mainstream.\nJeremy Ross: I think no one predicted skill.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: That's why NW become like they.\nyusheng kuo: They kind of eat their own dog food all the time.\nyusheng kuo: So they just start to be really good at like leading the pack even they don't have the best engineering, engineering mindset but they are like a really good product team.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's like cloud code is like terminal when everyone is using ide.\nyusheng kuo: When everyone is building around IDE and say okay, no, terminal is like so bare bone and it become like so good.\nyusheng kuo: It's like a lot of content intuitive thing.\nyusheng kuo: There's still just a pack a folder.\nyusheng kuo: I couldn't even think, okay, the way builder autonomous tool building is through just building its own folder.\nJeremy Ross: I love that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's like that kind of simplicity almost kind of like primary, you know like they.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, like a terminal, not ide.\nyusheng kuo: Like there's a pack of a skill like mcp.\nyusheng kuo: Early on it's not even like only like a local.\nyusheng kuo: So it's just like they're really good at creating this like really first principle stuff.\nyusheng kuo: That's like pretty good.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Yep, yep.\nJeremy Ross: I think this was a good call here.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nJeremy Ross: It's this.\nJeremy Ross: I think you should share this in a post or something.\nyusheng kuo: Oh yeah, yeah.\nJeremy Ross: I would have expected like at this point I would start to see like 80%.\nJeremy Ross: Oh, there we go.\nJeremy Ross: Just now hitting 51.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: But then look at all these reports that we've got.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: You, you was just.\nyusheng kuo: Do you remember the like the chart that we show?\nyusheng kuo: Like you can kind of using this type of thing like slow down.\nyusheng kuo: But eventually it was still like because of the amount of script and then amount of things he used to revise.\nyusheng kuo: His own work will still cram up the context but you just can go wait for it and everything is stored.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So it doesn't Lose when you come back.\nyusheng kuo: So they have the reference to go back to read the raw data.\nJeremy Ross: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So now actually a way I let agent do the work is like I combine.\nyusheng kuo: I use script to create this.\nyusheng kuo: So later on if you look at my agent MD file, I send it like a Friday.\nyusheng kuo: So I first like first few step is like a populated data.\nyusheng kuo: But then the final reasoning is actually using cloud code to read everything.\nyusheng kuo: So it's not really just like a common like agent workflow is like oh, I do ABC and then I combine everything and then send it to an anthropic API or like LLM call.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So actually I use.\nyusheng kuo: That's the benefit of cloud code is like he can actually just do a script for very efficient data population.\nyusheng kuo: Just like in clay you can create a lot of column.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: But instead of like a clay you send.\nyusheng kuo: You combine all the column and send it through API call.\nyusheng kuo: And then I got one shot that reasoning.\nyusheng kuo: Actually we can ask cloud code itself, the coding agent to read all the file he created to recursively understanding what's the most important thing and then generate a report.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so it's different from agent workflow.\nyusheng kuo: You have ABC and then you send A plus B plus C truncated as a huge file and then throw it into a one API call and expect it to a summary level.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so it's different.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's called agent reasoning.\nyusheng kuo: It have a lot of benefit like saving it.\nJeremy Ross: All right, well let's see.\nJeremy Ross: I think this is interesting.\nJeremy Ross: Let me see.\nJeremy Ross: So revival.\nJeremy Ross: So there it says there's eight reports and then it has all this extra data along the way.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Oh, these are just all the stages in the opportunity.\nJeremy Ross: Oh, that's interesting.\nJeremy Ross: Okay, then I can use that to reference later.\nyusheng kuo: But here's the thing, like this report is very mechanical.\nyusheng kuo: So one thing we can do further is actually ask it to read the raw file and to come up with something interesting.\nyusheng kuo: So typically he created this report through the script.\nyusheng kuo: He doesn't try to read the data.\nyusheng kuo: That's the tendency I noticed.\nyusheng kuo: Like you say, hey, help me to create a report.\nyusheng kuo: Actually like they would for example, help me to know if they are.\nyusheng kuo: They have intent.\nyusheng kuo: They actually create a script to create with the keyword he generated and just to detect the keyword.\nyusheng kuo: And he.\nyusheng kuo: So he tend to use this very algorithmic way to give you the the report.\nyusheng kuo: But that's not good because we actually wanted to read the data and come up with something interesting.\nyusheng kuo: So that's what we can do next.\nyusheng kuo: And then that actually can be Encoded into the later on the agent you can have a step like okay, review all the data you generated and do this.\nyusheng kuo: So just one example is like for example if I say hey, help me to read the Google review and to see who have the interest of our product, he typically will create a script and say for example, your product is law enforcement.\nyusheng kuo: You will try to say okay, then I will create a certain keyword law enforcement, legal something and use that to create a script to do the keyword detection.\nyusheng kuo: That's a very non intelligent way.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And he will read the output, say hey, here are this the one that have the interest.\nyusheng kuo: But what we typically want to do, I actually create a call to IMD to be more specific about is like.\nyusheng kuo: Like inter.\nyusheng kuo: Intertwine the script and the agent reasoning.\nyusheng kuo: So now you want to actually the agent to really read the review to come up with whether they are good or not.\nJeremy Ross: So in this case we've got eight reports.\nyusheng kuo: And so this is very mechanical.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: You get this is a good baseline.\nyusheng kuo: Exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So we can do the next.\nJeremy Ross: The baseline could be.\nJeremy Ross: These aren't just eight reports that are reports that anyone could pull together on HubSpot.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, right.\nJeremy Ross: These are eight reports that were actually if you look over here made up of like several different things.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nJeremy Ross: So a lot of contexts and then so the next step would be review all eight and come up with insights.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Like read the real conversation they have.\nyusheng kuo: Which one who actually.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, you probably better than me.\nyusheng kuo: Like here it doesn't read the email.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Or read the conversation.\nyusheng kuo: Read the meeting.\nyusheng kuo: You might say okay, among the revival one who actually have the best like possibility based on some of their conversation.\nyusheng kuo: You should go read and tell me like to do that.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: All right, let me see.\nyusheng kuo: So the way I would probably do it is I will probably choose like one report like a revival.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Or single threaded.\nyusheng kuo: Pick the one that certain thing that you can move.\nyusheng kuo: Not like a zero.\nJeremy Ross: Well, so what I was going to do was just tell it for the reports where you actually have some sort of count.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Read some of the most recent messages or message like email exchanges or whatever.\nJeremy Ross: Or notes.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, whatever you can find and surface the ones that seem like they have the most.\nJeremy Ross: I don't know to like revive.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But it's important to.\nyusheng kuo: To write it down.\nyusheng kuo: So later on before the.\nyusheng kuo: I will send you a article called Compound Engineering.\nyusheng kuo: So before you finish the context window, we need to do review.\nyusheng kuo: So you actually will record all the things you've done here.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: A good and bad.\nyusheng kuo: And then create a markdown so next time it will later on become the material for your agent.\nyusheng kuo: So your agent can follow this kind of step like suit.\nyusheng kuo: So even you are very air hoc now.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: But later on Adrian can do.\nJeremy Ross: Are you saying we should do that now before we do this secondary report?\nyusheng kuo: No, I think we can go on.\nyusheng kuo: I mean, I'm monitoring your contacts window, so I think you're fine.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Are you on Opus?\nJeremy Ross: Actually, that's a good.\nyusheng kuo: Question.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, you are.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Wait.\nyusheng kuo: Why Is this still 4.5?\nJeremy Ross: Maybe I could go to the.\nJeremy Ross: I don't know.\nJeremy Ross: Should have.\nyusheng kuo: It's okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's.\nyusheng kuo: It's.\nyusheng kuo: It's okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's not.\nJeremy Ross: You have 4.6.\nJeremy Ross: Maybe I need to restart.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, but let's don't restart now.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, you can just ask the question.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, wait.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: This will probably over like if you.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, copy.\nyusheng kuo: Copy this.\nJeremy Ross: We can edit it.\nJeremy Ross: We can edit it.\nJeremy Ross: Let me.\nJeremy Ross: Let me just finish this.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, no, I'm just saying like with this amount of data, we probably need to do compact first.\nJeremy Ross: Oh, I see what you're saying.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Just let me.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, you go ahead finish this and then we can copy this and then.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, right.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I hope there's a.\nyusheng kuo: There should be a multiplayer club code, right?\nJeremy Ross: Like that would be cool.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that would be cool.\nJeremy Ross: I guess you can do it with.\nJeremy Ross: Was it tail scale or.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I just.\nyusheng kuo: Because technically they are already like pair programming IDE or like terminal.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Actually like the two programmer can both doing things.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know if you can both type into the.\nyusheng kuo: The same chat box but.\nyusheng kuo: But you can definitely like spin out the same two cloud code instance.\nyusheng kuo: Then we're side by side and then one is doing one and the other doing the other.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's.\nyusheng kuo: That's definitely like there are this thing now because that.\nyusheng kuo: That already existed.\nyusheng kuo: It.\nJeremy Ross: With the Count and dig deeper into the actual meanings of those deals.\nJeremy Ross: Reach out to you today.\nJeremy Ross: Listen.\nJeremy Ross: Deals reasons why any insights you find.\nJeremy Ross: What do you think about that?\nyusheng kuo: One second.\nyusheng kuo: I'm sending the compound engineering plugin to you.\nyusheng kuo: So later on you can kind of try for other projects.\nyusheng kuo: But that's okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, let me.\nyusheng kuo: Let me read it.\nyusheng kuo: I'm not going to be better than you, but all I need just.\nyusheng kuo: Why inside.\nyusheng kuo: Fine.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I think it's pretty good.\nyusheng kuo: But just like copy that now.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, okay.\nyusheng kuo: And say document what we've done into just Give it a name.\nyusheng kuo: Baseline report md.\nyusheng kuo: What we done, what we done, what we done now Report.\nyusheng kuo: It's like the process.\nyusheng kuo: You wanted to record the process, not the fact.\nJeremy Ross: Okay, yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Document the process of what we've done.\nyusheng kuo: Into baseline report IMD.\nJeremy Ross: Md.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So later on we can even like edit this right.\nyusheng kuo: Directly so we can ask agent to update our process here.\nyusheng kuo: And that would be kind of like a code for agent future reference, like a spec, basically.\nJeremy Ross: So I made something like this.\nJeremy Ross: It's called forward slash sync.\nyusheng kuo: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Use that.\nJeremy Ross: And it does basically the same thing.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nJeremy Ross: So it looks for are there any to do's or tasks like the files and do those exist?\nJeremy Ross: And then like in the conversation, are there any outstanding tasks or anything that need to be recorded?\nJeremy Ross: And it records those.\nJeremy Ross: Then it also just looks at just what the conversation has been period.\nJeremy Ross: And it just, you know, pulls all that into its.\nJeremy Ross: Into a file.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I really feel like people who know how to use AI and people who doesn't would really feel like a day and night very soon.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Because it's such a like strong augmentation.\nyusheng kuo: It's probably even bigger than you know how to use use Excel.\nyusheng kuo: It's already a huge gap for people who doesn't know how to use Excel and use the paper.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, paper and pen.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like you can do way more than the people who use paper and pen.\nyusheng kuo: Unless you're Warren Buffett.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, you know the joke, right?\nyusheng kuo: Like he said, I don't need Excel.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, but, but yeah, like this type of.\nyusheng kuo: The leap is even further.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Actually I was using Excel earlier today and it was just really frustrating.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it barely.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, now he created and then we do compat, slash compat.\nyusheng kuo: I think soon compile will be removed.\nJeremy Ross: Well, hopefully, I mean, hopefully the context window gets way bigger or they figure something else out.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But it's also nice with the compact.\nyusheng kuo: You can kind of detect how they want to compare things compared to auto compact because no one haven't really cracked memory properly because there's just so many aid cases.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: OpenAI's memory is so annoying.\nyusheng kuo: Especially like if my wife and I both are using the same account and he would assume I'm my wife.\nyusheng kuo: He would try to inject some really weird thing and then he always tried to say, hey, even I asked some random thing.\nyusheng kuo: He was like, so this could be applied to data J. I was like, no, no, I don't need to.\nyusheng kuo: Do you want me to see how this can be used for no.\nyusheng kuo: Did you get that?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's like so annoying.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Oh, compacted.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, now we can do it.\nyusheng kuo: Funny thing.\nyusheng kuo: And also fun like interviewing with AI is so fun because yesterday I was like doing, I was trying to see okay, how can we better messaging and I was just like interview with chbt the voicemail and kind of just like keep feeding on it and it's actually a fun, fun, very fun like it.\nyusheng kuo: And then, and then like insightful discussion.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's just.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: You need to find a way to not like not let it to be too.\nyusheng kuo: What's that?\nyusheng kuo: What do you call like syncophatic or like but like too agreeable.\nJeremy Ross: Oh yeah.\nyusheng kuo: What's their worst?\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, it can be like therapeutic I guess.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then like I really feel like a co founder to some degree.\nyusheng kuo: It's of course not as tasteful as the real person with a real perspective but you can really bring in a lot of like different perspective to you.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Maybe, I don't know, maybe soon they will also have some kind of really good perspective.\nyusheng kuo: Like they're playing Go.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Based on some statistics.\nyusheng kuo: You know I, I remember like Devin CEO he actually believed everything probably have some kind of pattern behind.\nyusheng kuo: He said like does everything become kind of mining ball?\nyusheng kuo: Like he said early on when people play chess it feel like this is an instinct.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: It's something that you can codify and then, and then turn out the blue and then like like poker.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: When you play poker it also believe it's a very like humane interaction or even baseball.\nyusheng kuo: But now there are always some kind of really useful math to represent it to make you become money built and you always have better chance to win.\nyusheng kuo: I kind of to some degree agree with it.\nyusheng kuo: It's like well how do we even like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah even similarly like something that's not like a very mathematical representable turnout can be if you find the right algorithms.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, Yeah, maybe maybe even like a music industry.\nyusheng kuo: Could we think of that like how to create a hit song.\nJeremy Ross: Have you tried Suno?\nyusheng kuo: No.\nyusheng kuo: No.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's.\nJeremy Ross: It's pretty impressive.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I heard it's like still like impressive for people who don't know music too much but not impressed enough for people who.\nyusheng kuo: I think people like there is one professor say he's like better than my 90% of student but way worse than the top 1% of the student.\nyusheng kuo: It's almost like every AI application like that, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's better than 80, 90% of people but like very like subpar to those like elite Yeah I don't know how they.\nyusheng kuo: I think it's a bit of the.\nyusheng kuo: The data thing to some degree.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: I love this breakdown here.\nJeremy Ross: This document is awesome.\nyusheng kuo: Oh yeah, yeah they are so good at documentation.\nJeremy Ross: It was spot on.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Especially for baseline thing.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah it's very thought out.\nyusheng kuo: I think that's where really like cloud code can really compound over time for like a generation report generation.\nyusheng kuo: If we further allow like user to send an email and update.\nJeremy Ross: Okay so.\nJeremy Ross: Priority outreach report.\nJeremy Ross: Executive summary.\nyusheng kuo: And you probably can say to it like give me the reference point everything.\nJeremy Ross: Like what do you mean exactly?\nyusheng kuo: So so like where that call or where the like the.\nyusheng kuo: The the supporting evidence is from.\nJeremy Ross: Let me see.\nJeremy Ross: So it doesn't say on here why reach out today there's an active.\nyusheng kuo: IT.\nyusheng kuo: I feel they are.\nyusheng kuo: He is only using the not a real conversation but only using the notes.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Is there a note thing in hotspot?\nJeremy Ross: There are real email but it depends on like not every company uses HubSpot notes.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah but he said he's actually fetch front notes.\nJeremy Ross: Well it says emails here.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: Email like yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Objects.\nJeremy Ross: Oh it's just the subject line.\nJeremy Ross: It's not even the actual email.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Call, meeting notes, contact details, deal associations, engagement count.\nJeremy Ross: All raw data.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, let's.\nyusheng kuo: Let's.\nyusheng kuo: We can look at the raw data he actually referenced from.\nyusheng kuo: And like it seems it's May right?\nyusheng kuo: It's still a while ago.\nJeremy Ross: You said May.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I saw this something like say this is email is from May 8 last year.\nJeremy Ross: Okay so we have to put something like.\nJeremy Ross: There has to be some kind of time component then.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Say like well you probably need to give it some guidance.\nyusheng kuo: What do you think would be like a good hot deal?\nyusheng kuo: Like is it close loss?\nyusheng kuo: I don't know.\nyusheng kuo: It's like they need to wait for a while or.\nyusheng kuo: You can also ask it just to research something for like a relative new thing that's worth to.\nyusheng kuo: We can see it as activation.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah okay.\nyusheng kuo: But let's first check the email whatever get more to roll data in.\nJeremy Ross: Well yeah I wanted to get some more email.\nJeremy Ross: So it says it did not pull the email text HTML.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Then I call no, no, you're fine.\nJeremy Ross: Full conversation.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah so I don't want to like so I just want it to be like eel sitter on the edge of being lost potentially.\nJeremy Ross: I don't want to tell them to go after a bunch of lost deals ever.\nyusheng kuo: How do you know like how do.\nyusheng kuo: How do you as a manager you know who is actually a good.\nyusheng kuo: So.\nJeremy Ross: I Mean one would I. I think the things that they mentioned that it mentioned earlier were pretty spot on.\nJeremy Ross: So in general, like this stuff here, the original eight reports.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: These are all around deals around opportunities.\nJeremy Ross: Right.\nJeremy Ross: So the idea with the secondary report was to look at the conversations to actually get some sort of insights and like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Maybe why he lost like well no, not that.\nJeremy Ross: Not why.\nJeremy Ross: Why was it lost but because this would be a report that would go out regularly.\nJeremy Ross: You want to like give them some action points.\nJeremy Ross: Not like kind of having a.\nJeremy Ross: A retroactive or retro retrospective on their boss deal.\nyusheng kuo: Too pessimatic.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nJeremy Ross: All right.\nJeremy Ross: So I just want to tell it.\nJeremy Ross: So we could.\nyusheng kuo: If we just fetch out that should be probably fine.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, we'll see.\nyusheng kuo: Yolo.\nyusheng kuo: Yolo.\nyusheng kuo: The way he would just compare himself.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, we'll see.\nyusheng kuo: Because it's midway.\nyusheng kuo: I I think it's not worth.\nyusheng kuo: It's okay to auto compact because we don't have like a finished result yet.\nyusheng kuo: So it's okay.\nyusheng kuo: We don't.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: This is really auto compact.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Because a lot of them probably not relevant now and to some degree he already kind of record this outreach report.\nyusheng kuo: Priority outreach time.\nyusheng kuo: D. He's already kind of the.\nyusheng kuo: At this point the process hasn't been developed yet.\nyusheng kuo: Now we just need to record the fact.\nyusheng kuo: So here have some kind of fact.\nyusheng kuo: Can can look back.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, we record the process until we have a good process.\nyusheng kuo: You said be mindful of output parsing.\nyusheng kuo: So just to record only rather than check.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Like remove all the metadata, whatever format.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's another thing about co. Like that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Just like give me make sure the output JSON have a very clean data because I remember like hotspot would have the tons of like a rendering stuff like around like a times.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, That should be good.\nyusheng kuo: They know what clean.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Especially hotspot.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then.\nyusheng kuo: And then you don't need to worry about agent development.\nyusheng kuo: You just need to push this.\nyusheng kuo: I will develop the agent based on the.\nyusheng kuo: You just need to give me the chase, you know like the break crumb.\nJeremy Ross: Yep.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, got it.\nyusheng kuo: So that's the fun thing I really like is like I can go really ruse not like the writing code.\nyusheng kuo: I have to always think of the next step.\nyusheng kuo: Next step.\nyusheng kuo: I can just like leave a lot of chase and then make sure that all the trace are traceable.\nyusheng kuo: And later I can just go summarize say hey look at the whole freaking folder.\nyusheng kuo: What should I do?\nJeremy Ross: Looks like it gets truncated here.\nyusheng kuo: The result.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Like the bodies.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Then you should tell it.\nJeremy Ross: That's a bummer.\nyusheng kuo: You think it's an API thing or.\nJeremy Ross: I don't know.\nJeremy Ross: I mean there's probably like a setting you can put on the API.\nyusheng kuo: You just tell it.\nyusheng kuo: Don't.\nyusheng kuo: I don't want it to be trumpeted the full thing.\nyusheng kuo: It.\nyusheng kuo: But was that generated from the previous thing or current one?\nJeremy Ross: Was it generated from what?\nyusheng kuo: Sorry, the deal with email.\nJeremy Ross: The deal with emails.\nyusheng kuo: There was the data you looked at, right?\nJeremy Ross: Oh, the chunky one.\nJeremy Ross: It was just now generated.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, I see.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: Okay, that's definitely way different.\nJeremy Ross: Yes, we got everything.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, one thing.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, go back priority deal with and go back to the data.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: With email deal, Ask you to create a folder for each deal.\nyusheng kuo: Instead of like have everything in one file.\nJeremy Ross: Seems like it's wrapping up.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, don't, don't, don't let it wrap.\nyusheng kuo: Don't let it go.\nyusheng kuo: Like say, don't let it wrap.\nyusheng kuo: No, don't let it wrap yet.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, say hey, for priority deal with email, create folder for each deal and then the email content within the deal.\nyusheng kuo: So later on they can go more deeper into the each deal.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: For email.\nyusheng kuo: The idea is like generate the best possible report once for you.\nyusheng kuo: You know, then cloud code will figure out how to do it for everyone.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So you have to make sure you have a really good deal.\nyusheng kuo: Like a really good.\nyusheng kuo: That become like the, the.\nyusheng kuo: Once you have that kind of benchmark, it's actually very easy for, for cloud code to, to, to go to that process it.\nyusheng kuo: No, no, no.\nyusheng kuo: Don't, don't.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know.\nyusheng kuo: If I were you, I would say regenerated the priority deal with email, but instead of a big JSON, create the folder for each email content for each deal.\nJeremy Ross: So am I not saying it correctly here?\nJeremy Ross: Create a folder per deal for the rep.\nyusheng kuo: Or the email and.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, so.\nJeremy Ross: And fill eat.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, okay.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, Each with the email with the full email content.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Is that good?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Let's see, let's see.\nyusheng kuo: I can see the code, so I'll check.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, let's see.\nyusheng kuo: Let's see the output.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, we can see the output.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And I create a deal.\nyusheng kuo: Wait, so he already created that.\nyusheng kuo: Can you look at a deal on the left?\nyusheng kuo: Okay, that's fast.\nJeremy Ross: I thought he had way more deals than that.\nJeremy Ross: I guess these are the open deals.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: He's trying to populate the content.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, do.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nJeremy Ross: I can't.\nJeremy Ross: Scroll down.\nyusheng kuo: Click outside the box.\nyusheng kuo: Click and then scroll down again.\nyusheng kuo: Scroll down.\nyusheng kuo: What?\nyusheng kuo: Okay, cursor all the way down.\nJeremy Ross: This.\nyusheng kuo: See, that's a.\nyusheng kuo: That's the engineering part that I'm not good at.\nyusheng kuo: They're still so buggy.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nJeremy Ross: Here we.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, now we say before you create a report variety outreach, read the content and give me the result.\nJeremy Ross: But the report has already been made.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, let's take a look at report first.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, maybe it's good enough.\nyusheng kuo: We'll see.\nyusheng kuo: I don't want to just like a factual stuff.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's a bit too factual.\nJeremy Ross: You see, Look.\nJeremy Ross: Most recent email.\nJeremy Ross: So this should be marked.\nJeremy Ross: This deal should be marked as close lost.\nJeremy Ross: This is just dirty CRM.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: The.\nJeremy Ross: They just couldn't bear to close it out.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Then this is from December.\nJeremy Ross: Marketing webinar.\nyusheng kuo: All right.\nyusheng kuo: What do you think will be helpful for the rap side?\nyusheng kuo: Like who do you think actually should be reached out today?\nyusheng kuo: If you look at this factual data.\nyusheng kuo: Or any other supporting material you think you'll be needed?\nJeremy Ross: Not this one.\nyusheng kuo: No meeting.\nyusheng kuo: Are they doing well, this company?\nJeremy Ross: No, they are really.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: So.\nJeremy Ross: Well, we can go ahead and compact it.\nJeremy Ross: Zero meetings.\nJeremy Ross: What.\nyusheng kuo: It's it.\nJeremy Ross: I have a feeling that some of these deals are just like they were.\nJeremy Ross: It's not a deal.\nJeremy Ross: They just made it an opportunity record for it just to keep track of prospecting.\nJeremy Ross: Prospecting efforts.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know.\nJeremy Ross: There's definitely some dirty data in here.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But I think the nice thing the cloud code or like this kind of agent is it doesn't need to be perfect.\nyusheng kuo: Like you can actually in the cloud MD like they be judgmental tell if it's really the.\nyusheng kuo: You know, it doesn't need to be.\nyusheng kuo: You can use not just the.\nyusheng kuo: The opportunity but like looking at open deal and then to decide whether it's still open deal if you give it some kind of guidance.\nyusheng kuo: So that's actually be powerful.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like if you use like a hotspot report like generated.\nyusheng kuo: Bobby will always kind of give you something.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: Also, what the hell.\nJeremy Ross: It's 25 open deals, not nine.\nJeremy Ross: Oh, okay.\nyusheng kuo: But.\nyusheng kuo: But I would say in terms of like hotspot, they are doing okay.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: In terms of the data population.\nJeremy Ross: Well, what do you mean?\nyusheng kuo: Like how would you score their data readiness in hot.\nJeremy Ross: The.\nyusheng kuo: How good?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, how good they're.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: How good the data hygiene in.\nJeremy Ross: Oh, it's.\nJeremy Ross: I mean it's not.\nJeremy Ross: It's not that bad.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Pretty decent.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Like CRM really designed to be hard to like just impossible to use.\nyusheng kuo: Like.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Like.\nyusheng kuo: Like a 20 different feel like it's this update, it's not humanly possible thing.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Yep.\nJeremy Ross: It's.\nJeremy Ross: It's a joke with, with all sales managers.\nJeremy Ross: It's like you're always chasing salespeople to fill in fields and all this stuff.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: All right.\nyusheng kuo: It's just like looking at an engineer's jira.\nyusheng kuo: It will always like be too blunt.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: Updated.\nJeremy Ross: Priority.\nJeremy Ross: Open deals.\nJeremy Ross: Priority deals.\nyusheng kuo: We also important like last email, but does people respond it or like how do you.\nyusheng kuo: How do you like audit?\nyusheng kuo: Is there any other thing that would be useful to know what to prioritize?\nyusheng kuo: And it was like an email content the intended.\nJeremy Ross: I think really.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: So if I put on my manager hat, like my sales manager hat, I would say go after these five and like research the companies to see if anything has happened recently.\nJeremy Ross: So.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that could be the next step for this.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So ask you to research whether you use parallel.\nyusheng kuo: Do you have parallel here?\nJeremy Ross: Not in this one.\nJeremy Ross: Well, I guess I. I guess I do because I have.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Well, I don't know if you can use MCP here like in this.\nyusheng kuo: Can you.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, slash mcp.\nJeremy Ross: Oh, well that, that would have to.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: You do.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I'm pretty sure you have data gen here because you can install the.\nyusheng kuo: No, no, you don't.\nyusheng kuo: You don't need to.\nyusheng kuo: Why do you want to refresh?\nJeremy Ross: Why didn't refresh anything?\nJeremy Ross: I was just double checking.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, no, I definitely have it.\nyusheng kuo: Because I just realized Taylor is actually found the former tutor CEO, the one who got fired by Elon.\nyusheng kuo: He's actually.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So they have a lot of resources.\nyusheng kuo: That's why they are cheap.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: You say you can't use parallel or like use your own web research to do this.\nyusheng kuo: What do you study?\nyusheng kuo: What do you think that they need to study about them?\nJeremy Ross: So I have to.\nJeremy Ross: Let me direct it to my Codex folder.\nJeremy Ross: My other one.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: I have a.\nJeremy Ross: So it's in my other repo.\nJeremy Ross: Let me see.\nyusheng kuo: Or if you have a skill to do research, then yeah, you can.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, I need a skill for this.\nJeremy Ross: So I'll say.\nyusheng kuo: It.\nJeremy Ross: Here.\nJeremy Ross: Give me.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, I'm going to go on mute just for a second.\nyusheng kuo: Sure.\nyusheng kuo: It.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: I went to the final part of the word deals.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: So this worked out pretty well.\nJeremy Ross: So it's looking for things that would stall a deal that the rep might not know about.\nJeremy Ross: It also is looking for things that are related to what codec solves.\nJeremy Ross: If they had anything recently happen.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: We are basically creating the AR CRN now basically.\nyusheng kuo: And just on top of the existing crn, they don't even need to.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's a.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, this is pretty cool.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, Yeah, that's what I feel.\nyusheng kuo: It's like almost one agent is kind of like a small app.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And you can have a right app like to auto update to do something and then just like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then self improving with this.\nyusheng kuo: Oh yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's like everything's moving so fast.\nyusheng kuo: Like a lot of time you just need to rethink what's still true every six months.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: A lot, A lot of AI startup will soon become irrelevant with their current tech stack.\nJeremy Ross: 100%.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's like okay, it's both scary in there and then maybe none of it.\nyusheng kuo: You know the other, the other day I talked to like Scrap is like a VP of sales and he said he feel really worried about the whole.\nyusheng kuo: Oh I think Jordan also I put out something like that yesterday.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: He's like where the value prop for software business soon would be like when like for example like cloud open cloud can just like create everything on demand like for your personal use case.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Well the, the value is just having things in the cloud.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: This part it's like it's a pain in the neck to release things and like make it real.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: And multiplayer and all this.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: That's what I feel.\nyusheng kuo: It's like that's something still very lacking because once you want to do multiplayer and security will be so important.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like current cloud bot.\nyusheng kuo: That's something what I think our strength is like we become very cooperable.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: It's not like you wouldn't be able to cooperate with people on your cloud bot because everything is just too personal.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then there's no cloud idea of cloud so you cannot do like in multiplayer or like a multi space.\nyusheng kuo: Like yeah, it's like I feel we really need to hone in on this.\nyusheng kuo: Like you can deploy your cloud agent everywhere so it could be integrated into your system.\nyusheng kuo: It could be in the cloud and you can use anywhere.\nyusheng kuo: It doesn't need to be like only living your desktop.\nyusheng kuo: That's where most people still using cloud code nowadays.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, let me see.\nJeremy Ross: So Citibank is a real opportunity.\nJeremy Ross: They're under active consent orders, spending on compliance, transformation and yada yada yada.\nJeremy Ross: Circle is timely, anchorage is risky, small deal, blah blah blah.\nJeremy Ross: This looks pretty good.\nyusheng kuo: Let me see.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, but do you think it's actionable to like.\nJeremy Ross: Okay, let me, let me review.\nJeremy Ross: So I was just looking at the summary.\nJeremy Ross: Let me see this.\nJeremy Ross: See if it's actionable.\nyusheng kuo: Today.\nJeremy Ross: Okay, it says Citibank is a real opportunity.\nJeremy Ross: But then it says MasterCard.\nyusheng kuo: Wait, but is Citibank using it?\nJeremy Ross: Am I looking at the right thing?\nJeremy Ross: Okay, Where is saved here?\nJeremy Ross: Revolute is at the top still.\nJeremy Ross: I'm so confused.\nyusheng kuo: You said.\nJeremy Ross: I'm just gonna say I'm confused.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, you say, then why revolution?\nyusheng kuo: You are absolutely right.\nJeremy Ross: I. Yeah, I mean, that's what's going to happen.\nJeremy Ross: Let's see.\nJeremy Ross: So here's reports one through eight.\nJeremy Ross: And then this is the newest one.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And there's the only thing.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, do this command P. No, no, no, not here.\nyusheng kuo: Just at your VS code.\nyusheng kuo: So let's try to search command P and report priority output.\nyusheng kuo: Here's only one.\nyusheng kuo: Report priority output.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, there's only one.\nyusheng kuo: Maybe.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, close the preview.\nyusheng kuo: Maybe close the preview family.\nyusheng kuo: Close it.\nyusheng kuo: Maybe there's a cache data like you say.\nyusheng kuo: And then try to open it again.\nyusheng kuo: Open preview.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Now actually, Master carries.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: Started with the eight baseline reports.\nJeremy Ross: Flagged nine deals with less than five total engagements.\nJeremy Ross: Five deals with recent activity.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: And how many are here?\nJeremy Ross: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\nTitle: Internal meeting\nHost Email: No host email\nOrganizer Email: yusheng.kuo@datagen.dev\nCalendar Id: No calendar id\nFireflies Users: yusheng.kuo@datagen.dev\nParticipants: yusheng.kuo@datagen.dev\nDate: 1770611700000\nTranscript Url: https://app.fireflies.ai/view/01KH0AZQHY1YWE6976TB5WGZXD\nAudio Url: https://cdn.fireflies.ai/01KH0AZQHY1YWE6976TB5WGZXD/audio.mp3?Expires=1770835043&Policy=eyJTdGF0ZW1lbnQiOlt7IlJlc291cmNlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9jZG4uZmlyZWZsaWVzLmFpLzAxS0gwQVpRSFkxWVdFNjk3NlRCNVdHWlhEL2F1ZGlvLm1wMyIsIkNvbmRpdGlvbiI6eyJEYXRlTGVzc1RoYW4iOnsiQVdTOkVwb2NoVGltZSI6MTc3MDgzNTA0M319fV19&Signature=EN6q8Ka253ZkUeWCpjXLwpGNXkDYd~aIVadhHa1EhqzYSY3BWMvjGKdavlSCEYoac4mx00cbMxa1bdUJHD230HOGpFb1NCZmcA5XrH-jW20GIiBkhuJSq2ESLz9LAXjQ1ruHRU2lPgszAvJvN5W29SQeEu1qfzJgufZP8UsXVgvhsBruVVWNA4~yWHBH3BJueinTSNXqDcAgshVt36wnuvfnq5ctFIHdSG8jDIAhV8JtVb2EnzCsQfFG9TK-l1ismSFvAZ-o8BG5oj7vBFZ0R8afckv50c-~McmwENGhql11fQC~CmPuHTXyCS5Z1hlTweUd1Pwrji-HMrO1LT~9GA__&Key-Pair-Id=K25ZJR0UZVF4CM\nVideo Url: No video url\nDuration: 120.37000274658203\nMeeting Attendees: No meeting attendees\nCal Id: No cal id\nCalendar Type: No calendar type\nMeeting Link: https://meet.google.com/hoc-opjv-wus?authuser=1&pageId=none"
