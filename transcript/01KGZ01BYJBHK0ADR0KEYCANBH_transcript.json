Right.\nyusheng kuo: And then step C might depend on the output of step B.\nyusheng kuo: Those kind of a dependency graph is hard for Agent.\nyusheng kuo: But now they use task.\nyusheng kuo: So actually they can build out I.\nLohit Boruah: Think multi agent like that.\nLohit Boruah: No, like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: It's become like they used to call like agentic workflow, right.\nyusheng kuo: Like abc and then maybe C is doing some error and call.\nyusheng kuo: They call like agency workflow but.\nyusheng kuo: But they now call the workflow of agent and they become very interesting because every time you call some API you will need to do something like retry error out everything.\nyusheng kuo: But now when we use agents to do it, if it error out agent will just okay, we have to wait and then I can do it again.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so they become this kind of a robustness layer and then it will be even like for example, if this particular step is involving like the other day we were helping a user who's doing this kind of web research for this step instead of doing some predefined query which is like let agent learn from the previous step and to decide what query actually should be generated.\nyusheng kuo: And doing the query then he will actually based on the query result to decide, okay, I need to do more for the query.\nyusheng kuo: That's the thing, that's the traditional agentic workflow will kind of fail easily.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, you always have to kind of put in some kind of agent there.\nyusheng kuo: And then the biggest gain we see is just the speed of creation.\nyusheng kuo: It's just so much faster.\nyusheng kuo: Because for example, my 14 step enrichment I used to whether I want to code it up in Python or I want to do it in Clay, it's actually a lot of effort and A lot of times I don't know what I want to do.\nyusheng kuo: But now the way we build things is we just let in the flow.\nyusheng kuo: Let's first use this MCP like you're doing this enrichment and then let's do this web research.\nyusheng kuo: It doesn't look good.\nyusheng kuo: Let's do something else.\nyusheng kuo: Then we just try to record our steps like what we did and eventually we just say, okay, let's summarize it.\nyusheng kuo: Become a step by step, like agent.\nyusheng kuo: And then that step by step should become like the workflow that we actually like a skill, for example, so the speed and whenever we want to change something, we don't need to worry about.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, this step has to be before this step.\nyusheng kuo: We just like say, hey, we want to do something this.\nyusheng kuo: We test it and then say update the agent file like a prompt file basically.\nyusheng kuo: And then it would just update it.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, it's like it become very before it's always very bottom up, build up.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like we think of something that we need to build and then we think of all the intermediate step and then we first build out the step and see the result if that's what we like.\nyusheng kuo: And then we kind of go back to update the building stuff.\nyusheng kuo: But now with the agent we can just go through the floor.\nyusheng kuo: There's a very.\nyusheng kuo: Actually we just did it yesterday with Jeremy.\nyusheng kuo: He's helping the client to deploy the agent to study their HubSpot.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then they want to know like okay, what are the ghost town?\nyusheng kuo: Like what are the lead they need to reactivate?\nyusheng kuo: What are the lead they need to prioritize and don't know what we need to build.\nyusheng kuo: We just ask a cloud what other data there.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And then cloud just go explore and say okay, based on this data, what we think will be the natural next step.\nyusheng kuo: And then we just like continue to.\nyusheng kuo: Okay then for this person, we need to find his recent post.\nyusheng kuo: We need to find some recent news about this company.\nyusheng kuo: And then we see something.\nyusheng kuo: For example originally agent give us a hey, these are the good leads.\nyusheng kuo: But we see actually there are some leads are like a long time ago like still and as long as.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, let's just try to make sure that we don't try.\nyusheng kuo: When we say the good stale we means that we haven't contacted.\nyusheng kuo: We have been in contact with them like for the last three months.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: All of this just like we just along the way and then it become like the whole process.\nyusheng kuo: There are certain steps we need to be careful.\nyusheng kuo: But like every time before the compact just like say okay.\nyusheng kuo: Like summarize what we did and then this thing along with the tool.\nyusheng kuo: Just later on we just call this agent and then this agent actually will just generate a report for us for the, for the, for the, for the, for the, for the client.\nyusheng kuo: So like it's like very hard to do it in clay, very hard to do it code it up.\nyusheng kuo: But like nowadays this agent would just be able to do it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, that's, that's some of our, that's some of our learning is a very different way of development developing like agent or like automation.\nyusheng kuo: Like it's no longer told us like thanks to cloud code, we no longer start from coding actually we start from like outcome.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nLohit Boruah: Have you built anything, some trigger based.\nLohit Boruah: Like if this trigger happened, start running this agent, you know, have you built this something like that?\nLohit Boruah: Because.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nLohit Boruah: This is the reason currently I'm still using anything but I start soon start.\nLohit Boruah: Want to move to this phase.\nLohit Boruah: You know, I. I build this inside cloud code and then whenever something this will run and you know like yeah, it's maybe because I haven't have this in VPs.\nLohit Boruah: So what do you think?\nLohit Boruah: You know how we can solve that part?\nyusheng kuo: So I'm.\nyusheng kuo: I'm not selling you that but this is turned out to be what we actually building.\nyusheng kuo: So I can try to show you that.\nyusheng kuo: So you see this all the.\nyusheng kuo: So if you go to Datagen, right, You can basically connect to your repo.\nyusheng kuo: Like here, this is one of our repo, right?\nyusheng kuo: And once you connect this repo we will read here is for example.\nyusheng kuo: Can you see my screen?\nyusheng kuo: Actually yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So here's my cursor, right?\nyusheng kuo: So you can see that within my agent file I have this async email.\nyusheng kuo: Like this, this async email.\nyusheng kuo: I have this like a daily activity report email and a meeting summary agent.\nyusheng kuo: You can see actually these are all just different agents, right?\nyusheng kuo: I created.\nyusheng kuo: You probably have created that within Kako.\nyusheng kuo: But it's only like working manually, right.\nyusheng kuo: And then we can just.\nyusheng kuo: When you connect your repo to this, it will automatically discover all the agent you have basically the agent file or command file or skill file.\nyusheng kuo: And then like for example for this one, I already deployed this one.\nyusheng kuo: Let me deploy another one.\nyusheng kuo: Like say I have this async email.\nyusheng kuo: I just hit this deploy agent.\nyusheng kuo: You see you actually create a unique webhook URL and then you can just use this web URL to for example fireflies to be triggered automatically.\nyusheng kuo: So for example we have this meeting summary agent meeting summarize agent, right?\nyusheng kuo: So I Create this meeting summarizer trigger.\nyusheng kuo: And this trigger can be used by your nan.\nyusheng kuo: Like any kind of trigger type NAN created.\nyusheng kuo: You can directly trigger your car code agent here.\nyusheng kuo: And then all I need to do is just copy this trigger into my fireflies.\nyusheng kuo: And then Firefly have like webhooked right.\nyusheng kuo: We now almost like exclusive only work with the service that have webhook.\nyusheng kuo: So we go to developer setting and we just need to give this webhook.\nyusheng kuo: So every time that after this meeting right.\nyusheng kuo: You will actually create this email like showing us what actually be summarized and then they actually calling this agent to give us this summarize.\nyusheng kuo: And then he will also send out this email.\nyusheng kuo: For example I just get this email say okay, here's your daily activity report.\nyusheng kuo: And then he will actually do tell me what to do and then I can email back this agent to ask a question like okay, what about.\nyusheng kuo: What about David?\nyusheng kuo: Like what he actually.\nyusheng kuo: What kind of tool actually he used.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So that's how we, how we are building this kind of a lot of agent, whatever agent your repo, you can actually use that outside in the external system.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's what the trigger base that we're building.\nyusheng kuo: And then in nan, as long as you have a webhook trigger, you can actually use all the trigger they have.\nyusheng kuo: And then just next step is just giving that this webhook URL.\nyusheng kuo: Then this agent will be able to trigger and then, and then call back to whatever service you have.\nLohit Boruah: Yeah, yeah, I understood.\nLohit Boruah: So one thing last time you mentioned that you're building like a CLAY alternative, right?\nyusheng kuo: Like yeah.\nLohit Boruah: So like how.\nLohit Boruah: What's your progress on that?\nLohit Boruah: Like you know like do you able to build that using cloud code?\nyusheng kuo: So we actually are moving more toward like agent based enrichment.\nyusheng kuo: So one thing we think that CLAY is pretty good is that clay can run a lot of like action like in parallel, right?\nLohit Boruah: Exactly, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: But it's very time consuming to build things in clay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So what we did instead is actually I can show you one of our example here.\nyusheng kuo: I think it's calling GTM os.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: We actually created this agent that's here.\nLohit Boruah: So you have inside one folder you have multiple agents.\nLohit Boruah: Is it?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: You could, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: You can have so many agents.\nyusheng kuo: So that's why I have like.\nyusheng kuo: Why I have so many agents that's in one repo.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And then they all are like reading the same repository but they are responsible for different things.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Like here we have a hey Rich reply drafter.\nyusheng kuo: So every time someone like linking me, my agent will just Read my how I want to reply and then reply.\nyusheng kuo: So I have like a report like this guy like describing for example the meeting summarizer, right?\nyusheng kuo: You can see the prompt.\nyusheng kuo: So I say okay, whenever you see the Firefly webpool payload, that's what the payload will look like.\nyusheng kuo: You should first go download the transcript.\nyusheng kuo: You can use the meeting classification so you can further refer to the internal repository file.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: To say how I want to do internal word meeting summarization.\nyusheng kuo: How do I want to do external meeting summarization.\nyusheng kuo: And that become just like one agent.\nyusheng kuo: So you can like one repo.\nyusheng kuo: You can have all the shared contacts.\nyusheng kuo: But doing like a different thing and being the reason is like we.\nyusheng kuo: You can have so many different trigger is like different agents like they can be triggered by different system, right?\nyusheng kuo: Like hey Rich is triggered whenever there's a link in.\nyusheng kuo: So hey Rich will send me a webhook and that would trigger this agent.\nyusheng kuo: And then when I have a like a meeting summarizes whenever the firefly that will have a web coming in meeting summarizer will be responsible for that.\nyusheng kuo: And then we also have this type of like a daily activity.\nyusheng kuo: It's actually on schedule.\nyusheng kuo: So it's like every day on AM you will try to run it.\nyusheng kuo: So it's just like very easy to build a lot of like automation for us.\nyusheng kuo: And they all are like looking at the same thing.\nyusheng kuo: And after.\nyusheng kuo: After they finish, right.\nyusheng kuo: It will just help me to.\nyusheng kuo: This one doesn't have the PR but I gave.\nyusheng kuo: Do we look at this one.\nLohit Boruah: So you mean like this?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, you can.\nLohit Boruah: Yes, sorry.\nyusheng kuo: After the finish, right.\nyusheng kuo: If they try to write something it will actually create a PR so you can kind of review the context in your repository.\nyusheng kuo: Like what file has been changed.\nyusheng kuo: I added more like activity error and whatever the report is to my daily report.\nyusheng kuo: So later on my agent can actually refer to them.\nyusheng kuo: Is like a.\nyusheng kuo: Like a.\nyusheng kuo: To do like a memory.\nyusheng kuo: And then you can merge after this you can just like okay, I wanna.\nyusheng kuo: I wanna merge this one and we'll just.\nyusheng kuo: It will just become in your repository contacts for the next agent call.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, go ahead.\nyusheng kuo: Sorry.\nLohit Boruah: You mean like this.\nLohit Boruah: The data gen is solving this wave.\nLohit Boruah: Uh, you know, web like agent call issue.\nLohit Boruah: Which quote code like where we need to manually call the agent.\nLohit Boruah: But yeah, using that agent like whenever the trigger happen you it will call the agent.\nLohit Boruah: It will do the output and you know it's get that output, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: We try to basically turn it into a deployment.\nyusheng kuo: Your cloud code agent like you already have that right.\nyusheng kuo: We, we just take care of that.\nyusheng kuo: We make it run in cloud everywhere that can be scaled.\nyusheng kuo: Like for example, if there is a ten web hook all coming in the same time.\nyusheng kuo: So that's one thing we want to do with Clay now is because Clay can call the webhook, right?\nyusheng kuo: You can post the webhook.\nyusheng kuo: So we want to let Clay to be like a parallel runner.\nyusheng kuo: For example, you build a very simple list, but you want to do all the enrichment downstream.\nyusheng kuo: So instead of creating like workflow, you can just deploy this enrichment agent.\nyusheng kuo: Like for example, this hey, care enrichment agent.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And then this agent eventually will just create this very complicated structured data file and send it back to your Clay table.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, that's just the one way instead of like so we can.\nyusheng kuo: You can just build in cloud code and then just one click this agent, this agent become API, right.\nyusheng kuo: And then yeah, yeah, that's how we are.\nyusheng kuo: So when you ask us like the progress we are because originally we try to be like making Clay, making cloud code, have some component that like to do something like fully replace Clay.\nyusheng kuo: But it's not quite at first, it's not reliable and it's still very.\nyusheng kuo: One thing we really want to solve is like okay, even you don't know how to code, you can still have very clear understanding of what's going on, right?\nyusheng kuo: But whenever in CAL code you kind of at some point start to code.\nyusheng kuo: And.\nyusheng kuo: One of the issue we see is you start to draft some kind of code at some certain point that you don't know.\nyusheng kuo: So we want to go back.\nyusheng kuo: I probably will ask you on that one.\nyusheng kuo: So we kind of want to go back on a very tool level because the tool output is very.\nyusheng kuo: You won't change, won't happen.\nyusheng kuo: You won't change on the fly when you are trying to generate a code.\nyusheng kuo: Because whenever the tool call is like an API call, you have a fixed input, you have a fixed output.\nyusheng kuo: But that's more controllable, to put it more of a concrete example.\nyusheng kuo: Actually I probably can show you this one.\nyusheng kuo: What this do is this is an enrichment agent.\nyusheng kuo: He's running on the Solnet.\nyusheng kuo: And then here's the input schema.\nyusheng kuo: That's what Clay will actually say will come in, showing in and then what actually Clay will get out of it.\nyusheng kuo: And then here's the pipeline, right?\nyusheng kuo: The first step is like we need to get the company data and we use this tool and then we will save this to output to our temporary file so it doesn't cramp up the.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nLohit Boruah: What you're using to get the company data because clay I think sub data source.\nLohit Boruah: But what you're using as a.\nLohit Boruah: To get this data like you know how you're enriching them.\nyusheng kuo: So we are basically we.\nyusheng kuo: We provide not just this one, we actually help you to configure tool that's in data gen.\nyusheng kuo: So you can have all the tool like here.\nyusheng kuo: Basically you have a lot of MCP server, right.\nyusheng kuo: And each server like for example that you can have like disco like server, you can have Firefly, you can have firecraw server, you can have search server.\nyusheng kuo: So like you can see actually I have a lot of tool here and like for the linking tool.\nyusheng kuo: I have it here.\nLohit Boruah: Yeah, for LinkedIn like what you're using like means what MCP you're using for linking.\nLohit Boruah: Yeah, for LinkedIn.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, LinkedIn we build our own MCP tool and then it's like a default tool in data gen. No.\nLohit Boruah: So what's the backend of this like?\nyusheng kuo: Oh, oh, the backend is scrapping.\nyusheng kuo: We're using scrapping API.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nLohit Boruah: So you're just scrapping LinkedIn so they're not blocking your accounts?\nyusheng kuo: No, no, we are using API service called scrapping.\nyusheng kuo: This one.\nLohit Boruah: Oh yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, you don't need to use the.\nyusheng kuo: You can technically just wrap this API and SSQL Right.\nyusheng kuo: And then you just need to manage your credential there.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, you don't need to have to use mcp.\nyusheng kuo: I like to use MCP like because it's almost kind of like you use clay because everything is there, right.\nyusheng kuo: So you can just pull the tool.\nyusheng kuo: You don't need to say hey, because every time they look up the MCP they have to look up the documentation, everything.\nyusheng kuo: Or you have to build up your own skill.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And then there's no standard.\nyusheng kuo: There's not a lot of like a data related skill.\nyusheng kuo: But like MCP for example like I have disco like mcp.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Those are like a data provider already rapid as a service that you don't need to like build your own skill.\nyusheng kuo: So that's why we like to use MCP and then you can just like basically it's kind of slow.\nyusheng kuo: You can just like add more MCP here.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nLohit Boruah: What's your market?\nLohit Boruah: Because I think that's a year.\nLohit Boruah: Maybe we can partner.\nLohit Boruah: Right?\nLohit Boruah: I for agency we start using this and come up with new polar statement where maybe we learn some from you guys then you know.\nLohit Boruah: Yeah, implement it.\nLohit Boruah: Then it'll let you know how it's working and where we find the bottleneck will let you know so you can improve auto of that.\nLohit Boruah: And same time I can talk about this in LinkedIn, right?\nLohit Boruah: Hey, we are using this with this.\nLohit Boruah: Yeah, yeah, it's created in high plus because yeah, I know kind of hardcore user of float code.\nLohit Boruah: So I can start talking about data gen, like how we are using all this, you know, because I don't think many people know about all this.\nLohit Boruah: So it's kind of plus, you know, educating the audience about.\nLohit Boruah: But yeah, but also with time we need to build a robust solution because Clay is people looking to replace Clay.\nLohit Boruah: But.\nLohit Boruah: But they not have the technicality.\nLohit Boruah: Plus they don't know how to, you know, do that.\nLohit Boruah: So I think there's a huge gap in the market suddenly.\nyusheng kuo: So what you want to do.\nyusheng kuo: Like you want.\nyusheng kuo: Sorry, like.\nyusheng kuo: Like you.\nyusheng kuo: You see the market is replacing Clay.\nyusheng kuo: Like you want to have a tool that can replace clay is what you are looking for.\nLohit Boruah: Yeah, I see.\nyusheng kuo: Mano.\nyusheng kuo: I. I was actually.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's not something we try to achieve.\nyusheng kuo: We see ourselves as a very different product to Clay.\nyusheng kuo: We.\nyusheng kuo: If anything we probably will complement Clay.\nyusheng kuo: But yeah, that.\nyusheng kuo: That's the.\nyusheng kuo: That's.\nyusheng kuo: That's the feeling we have like in terms of the market.\nyusheng kuo: We actually now we want to help using this because like developing.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know if you try to develop Agent in Kako, but actually develop Agent in Kako is very fast, right.\nyusheng kuo: And then you can bring in all the company contacts into this very rich repository and you have like a git building to manage them.\nyusheng kuo: One of the recent success we have is actually we just sell this whole repo to the client and then they have all the agent and then they will run on our platform like they will daily, daily getting this.\nyusheng kuo: Like for example, here's one of the agent we were working with.\nLohit Boruah: One question here.\nLohit Boruah: No.\nLohit Boruah: While doing the output, how you make sure that the.\nLohit Boruah: Oh your code don't get changed while you're running for an input?\nLohit Boruah: You know, so how that you're gonna make or you make sure that.\nyusheng kuo: You mean how do I make sure the output is like correct?\nLohit Boruah: Because sometimes you know, we.\nLohit Boruah: When you do a request you sometime your code get changed, right.\nLohit Boruah: So instead of without changing the code, how you make sure we get the exact output we were looking for?\nLohit Boruah: You know, because sometime cloth code change the code, right?\nLohit Boruah: Based on.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nLohit Boruah: But I don't want to change it.\nLohit Boruah: I just want take this as input.\nLohit Boruah: Just give the output.\nLohit Boruah: No, without changing any code.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's, that's why I feel tool is so useful Here because tool like cloud code couldn't see what's underlying the tool.\nyusheng kuo: It can only execute the tool.\nyusheng kuo: So you couldn't change the code.\nyusheng kuo: So that's what, that's what we are doing here.\nyusheng kuo: That's why they can only like call the like.\nyusheng kuo: For example, each of them is like a step markdown, right?\nyusheng kuo: And then, then you can see actually I just tell it, okay, you should just use this tool and then this is the data you should extract from your understanding.\nyusheng kuo: Eventually agent will create this JSON file.\nyusheng kuo: It's not a code based.\nyusheng kuo: It's actually agent will go ahead and create this JSON file.\nyusheng kuo: Eventually we have a hook to validate the schema.\nyusheng kuo: So you can make sure the schema is correct.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so that, that's kind of our way to, to come to.\nyusheng kuo: To QA the data output.\nLohit Boruah: How you make sure this not get changed.\nLohit Boruah: Like when whenever you do a request this still same but you get the output.\nLohit Boruah: Like what's.\nLohit Boruah: How you make sure that where you made the request then where you ask for the input in cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: So, so for this one it would be like every time it was just try to look up the input schemainput JSON.\nyusheng kuo: So you will actually when you deploy this agent, this agent will actually just request for.\nyusheng kuo: We can take a look at this one.\nyusheng kuo: For this agent he would just request for the company name here.\nyusheng kuo: That's the only thing.\nyusheng kuo: And then company domain.\nLohit Boruah: Do you build a like interface like UI where you give this input so it don't change the backend because if you make do a request in float code it will change the code.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nLohit Boruah: But if you have a UI it not change the back end because you're just giving the input and give you the output is it?\nyusheng kuo: No, we actually don't create that.\nyusheng kuo: We just like we're still using the chip interface.\nyusheng kuo: So.\nyusheng kuo: But the thing we learned is like if you structure this world enough like the agent would not try to modify it because they realize okay, this is kind of the input that you want to do.\nyusheng kuo: What I typically will try to modify is what an intermediate step.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: But again because you give it like a tool instead of the code so they don't go go change.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, actually I have a meeting coming now.\nyusheng kuo: I, I do want to continue to, to talk with you.\nyusheng kuo: And what time is it at your time?\nLohit Boruah: It's 10 here.\nLohit Boruah: 10:00pm Now.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Because my next meeting may take like an hour.\nyusheng kuo: I will ping you if, I will ping you if you still available.\nyusheng kuo: We can continue to pick up from there.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I think we can talk because I think I do see the opportunity to collaborate but probably not just simply as a clay alternative.\nyusheng kuo: What I wanted to say is actually probably the very bottom line is actually like we start to be able to provide people like an email of okay for this account executive, right.\nyusheng kuo: What his.\nyusheng kuo: His kind of his daily report and he can like ask question about this.\nyusheng kuo: So we basically give every a.\nyusheng kuo: Every rep and agent their personal agent for pipeline or meeting prep or whatever through this central repository.\nyusheng kuo: So it's a slightly different offering than clay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, not slightly.\nyusheng kuo: It's different.\nLohit Boruah: Yeah yeah.\nLohit Boruah: I was.\nLohit Boruah: I will also want in the same position where no we build something we know which is still we have mass people.\nLohit Boruah: You know where.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then.\nyusheng kuo: And the etcher Clay could be a part of the like because they still wanted to outreach.\nyusheng kuo: They still want to declare and Clay data actually can be fit into this repository.\nyusheng kuo: Actually this decision making is based on the clay table.\nLohit Boruah: Yeah.\nLohit Boruah: Yeah.\nLohit Boruah: We can just use clay and do the WeBook call and Clay do the this building part and do the whole part but in automated way, you know.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So I have to round now but yeah, let me.\nyusheng kuo: Let's.\nyusheng kuo: Let's.\nyusheng kuo: Let's book a meeting tomorrow.\nyusheng kuo: You shoot me the calendar link or just book another.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, cool cool.\nyusheng kuo: Thank you.\nLohit Boruah: Bye Bye bye.\nTitle: 30 Min Meeting between Yusheng Kuo and Lohit Boruah\nHost Email: yusheng.kuo@datagen.dev\nOrganizer Email:
