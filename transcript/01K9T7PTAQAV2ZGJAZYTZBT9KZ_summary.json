58:30)\nEmphasized importance of dogfooding MCP gateways internally to foster adoption and improve product development with real use cases.\nPlanned to continue discussions and seek real feedback for product-market fit and potential pivoting strategies.\n, Notes: ## **Product-Market Fit and Use Case Validation**\n\nThe core challenge identified is the **lack of clear product-market fit for MCP (Middleware for Composable Platforms)**, with consensus that its current use cases do not deliver immediate, measurable value to mainstream users (15:03).\n\n- **William Lee and Yusheng Kuo agreed that proving ROI for MCP remains difficult** because the product mainly improves developer productivity, which is hard to quantify without explicit measurement (15:40).\n    - William emphasized that once productivity improvements are measured, multiple stakeholders demand a share of the metric, complicating attribution.\n    - Yusheng noted that positioning MCP as a developer tool is challenging since developers prefer building tailored solutions themselves.\n    - Both concluded that MCP struggles as a middleware vendor because it sits between vendors and end users, limiting clear value capture.\n    - They advised that MCP\u2019s value is better realized when adopted by vendors rather than as a standalone middleware product.\n\n- **The product\u2019s limited appeal to everyday users was highlighted**, with William pointing out that non-developers do not currently find MCP compelling or see ROI from it (41:28).\n    - Early adopters were mainly hardcore developers or workaholics, not mainstream consumers.\n    - William predicted that MCP could gain traction only when combined with entertainment platforms, leveraging addictive, dopamine-driven user interactions (41:46).\n    - The team agreed that MCP's current form lacks consumer engagement and that targeting professional white-collar workers with general personal assistants is premature and unfounded.\n\n- **There is skepticism about the personal assistant use case** because it does not save significant time for most users and lacks a clear pain point to address (38:06).\n    - William and Yusheng argued that focused tools like research or PowerPoint assistants have clearer value than broad personal assistants.\n    - This reflects a strategic shift towards solving concrete problems over inspirational or generalized automation.\n\n## **Strategic Positioning and Market Outlook**\n\nThe discussion framed MCP\u2019s success as dependent on ecosystem maturity and long-term endurance rather than quick wins (53:33).\n\n- **William stressed that MCP is in a \u201ctarpit phase,\u201d requiring psychological endurance and ecosystem readiness** before it can achieve commercial momentum (37:29).\n    - He cautioned that widespread adoption depends on vendors and the broader ecosystem agreeing on standards and integrations.\n    - The absence of core features like authentication in MCP protocols was noted as a barrier slowing market readiness (54:24).\n    - Yusheng echoed that timing is critical, and the ultimate winner will be the one who perseveres through the slow build-up rather than the first mover (54:40).\n\n- **Competitive insights highlighted the difficulty of building middleware unicorns**, with references to Postman\u2019s long journey to success (36:08).\n    - William shared that the journey to IPO and market dominance can take a decade or more.\n    - This perspective shaped a patient, long-term vision for MCP rather than immediate scale.\n\n- **MCP\u2019s horizontal compatibility challenges and vertical stack integration remain unresolved** (48:59).\n    - Yusheng raised concerns about how MCP can stack vertically without losing compatibility.\n    - This technical challenge underpins uncertainty about MCP\u2019s business viability (50:04).\n    - William and Yusheng agreed that MCP may not be a good standalone business at this stage.\n\n## **Product Architecture and Developer Experience**\n\nThe team converged on the approach of providing MCP as a **neutral, opinionated toolset that empowers agent developers to decide key behaviors** (32:21).\n\n- **William argued that MCP should be flexible, letting developers define agent persistence, memory, and execution environments** based on use cases (32:21).\n    - Persistent agents can maintain rolling memories; ephemeral agents can start fresh each session.\n    - The middleware should avoid over-prescribing defaults to remain broadly useful.\n    - This design philosophy balances developer freedom with necessary opinions to keep tools practical.\n\n- **Technical details about agent operation included using markdown files for SOP updates and embedding actions triggered by CI/CD pipelines** (25:02).\n    - This system keeps agent operating procedures automatically updated without redesigning backend databases.\n    - It enables agents to retrieve the most current instructions as tools, ensuring operational accuracy.\n\n- **Security and sandboxing are critical concerns**, as running agents in isolated VMs increases engineering complexity and risk (51:53).\n    - William emphasized that sandboxing is important for security, but it complicates development.\n    - The trade-off between integration as a tool versus a self-contained environment depends on agent use cases (14:06).\n\n- **The team agreed that \u201cmemory\u201d in agents is still largely a retrieval mechanism rather than true persistent memory** (29:16).\n    - Current memory solutions reduce token usage but don\u2019t fundamentally change interaction models.\n    - Developers need to build custom memory behaviors depending on agent goals.\n\n## **Product Roadmap and Business Priorities**\n\nThe conversation revealed a preference to **focus development on concrete, narrowly defined use cases rather than broad ambitions** like personal assistants or inspirational apps (47:43).\n\n- **William and Yusheng suggested targeting specific industry niches with reusable components that solve real problems** (20:14).\n    - This approach allows quick validation by pitching to a dozen companies and pivoting if interest is low.\n    - Institutional knowledge capture and scaling beyond consultancy is a key challenge for these niche products.\n\n- **They recommended prioritizing applications that make jobs easier rather than trying to inspire users** (47:43).\n    - William noted that apps aiming to inspire people rarely succeed.\n    - Practical tools with clear ROI are more likely to gain traction and justify investment.\n\n- **The team debated the scalability of the venture studio model funded by profits from a decentralized exchange that raised $600k** (01:07).\n    - William explained that the $600k was insufficient to run a venture studio directly but was supplemented by profits.\n    - This contextualizes resource constraints and the need for pragmatic prioritization in product investments.\n\n- **Short-term goals include landing pilot projects quickly to validate MCP\u2019s use cases and deciding whether to continue investing in the platform or pivot** (00:26).\n    - The team set a one-week target to secure pilots to enable further interviews and deeper engagement.\n    - William emphasized the importance of honest feedback to decide whether to continue or refocus efforts (57:50).\n\n## **Insights on Automation and Agent Development Philosophy**\n\nThe team shared nuanced views on **automation approaches, balancing spec-driven development against natural language coding** (10:55).\n\n- **William advocated for spec-driven development as a robust approach for automation**, where deterministic, code-based flows reduce failure rates to near 99.99% (10:55).\n    - Spec-driven automation is ideal for repetitive tasks with high reliability needs.\n    - Natural language-based approaches offer flexibility but incur higher failure rates and latency.\n\n- **They acknowledged that both approaches will coexist**, with trade-offs depending on brittleness tolerance and latency sensitivity (10:55).\n    - Spec-driven flows excel where bugs are costly; natural language suits exploratory or low-stakes tasks.\n    - William suggested tooling should allow agent developers to select their preferred model.\n\n- **The concept of sub-agent creation as a future method for coding agents was discussed**, hinting at modular agent architectures that anyone can build (04:52).\n    - This may enable more tailored, scalable agent ecosystems.\n    - The team recognized this as theoretical but promising for long-term evolution.\n\n- **William emphasized the need for tooling that integrates code execution within the agent environment**, supporting Python or other languages as tools (14:06).\n    - This supports secure, sandboxed execution with flexible model calls.\n    - The approach aligns with the vision of agents as orchestrators of multiple tool calls.\n\n## **Market and Ecosystem Context**\n\nThe team positioned MCP and agent middleware within a broader landscape dominated by platforms focused on **gambling, dating, entertainment, and dopamine-driven products** (42:05).\n\n- **William pointed out that these verticals capture massive revenue ($1 billion+ annual revenue in decentralized exchanges referenced) and user attention** (45:55).\n    - He suggested that personal agents will gain mainstream appeal only when integrated with entertainment platforms.\n    - The dopamine-driven interaction model (swipe left/right, etc.) is key to user engagement at scale (44:27).\n\n- **They acknowledged that many AI automation startups fail due to lack of clear user pain points or engagement hooks** (37:49).\n    - The team remains cautious about personal automation and assistant products without strong ROI.\n    - Emphasis is on building tools that solve real, measurable problems in professional workflows.\n\n- **The team recognized the importance of ecosystem standards and first-party support for MCP adoption** (56:12).\n    - William pushed for internal dogfooding of MCP gateways to encourage external adoption.\n    - Lack of vendor effort in standardizing MCP features like authentication hinders broader ecosystem growth.\n\n- **The conversation concluded with a pragmatic view that the MCP market and product maturity will emerge over years, not months**, requiring patience and aligned ecosystem development (53:33)., Overview: - **Product-Market Fit Challenge:** MCP lacks clear product-market fit; current use cases aren't providing measurable value to mainstream users.\n\n- **Developer Productivity ROI:** Difficulty in quantifying ROI for MCP since it primarily improves developer productivity; attribution complicates metrics sharing. \n\n- **Target Audience Concerns:** MCP's appeal is limited; non-developers find it uninteresting and don't perceive ROI; need for consumer-oriented engagement highlighted.\n\n- **Strategic Ecosystem Positioning:** Success depends on ecosystem maturity and standards adoption; slow build-up is vital over quick gains.\n\n- **Focus on Concrete Use Cases:** Development should target specific industry niches with practical tools providing clear ROI, avoiding broad ambitions.\n\n- **Ecosystem Standardization Importance:** Internal adoption of MCP standards is crucial for external acceptance; maturity will take years, not months., Bullet Gist: \ud83d\udcc9 Product-Market Fit Challenge: MCP lacks clear product-market fit; current use cases aren't providing measurable value to mainstream users.\n\ud83d\udcca Developer Productivity ROI: Difficulty in quantifying ROI for MCP since it primarily improves developer productivity; attribution complicates metrics sharing.\n\ud83d\udeab Target Audience Concerns: MCP's appeal is limited; non-developers find it uninteresting and don't perceive ROI; need for consumer-oriented engagement highlighted.\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Focus on Concrete Use Cases: Development should target specific industry niches with practical tools providing clear ROI, avoiding broad ambitions.\n\ud83d\udd04 Ecosystem Standardization Importance: Internal adoption of MCP standards is crucial for external acceptance; maturity will take years, not months., Gist: The meeting focused on evaluating the product-market fit of MCP and discussing strategies for overcoming challenges in its adoption and value delivery., Short Summary: The meeting centered on the challenges faced by MCP (Middleware for Composable Platforms) in achieving product-market fit, with participants William Lee and Yusheng Kuo highlighting the difficulty in demonstrating return on investment (ROI) due to its primary focus on enhancing developer productivity.
