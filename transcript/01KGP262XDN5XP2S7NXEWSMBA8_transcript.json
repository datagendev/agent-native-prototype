I got in there and then I got a little lost and I was in the middle of that ball with B2B catalyst and so they wanted me.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Tell me, tell me where you get lost.\nyusheng kuo: That'll be.\nyusheng kuo: That'll be so practice.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, you should like, whenever you get lost, you should like try to like capture it relentlessly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, because like you only have one.\nyusheng kuo: One.\nyusheng kuo: Like there's like a version, right?\nyusheng kuo: Like a, like a, like a best rookie.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: You only get one chance to get confused.\nJeremy Ross: Yes, that's a good point.\nJeremy Ross: All right, so here's what I. Oh.\nyusheng kuo: No, no, no, no, that's not, that's not.\nyusheng kuo: That's not the, Our agent.\nyusheng kuo: That's the GitHub.\nJeremy Ross: So why am I rece.\nJeremy Ross: Oh, this is from GitHub.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, this is from GitHub.\nyusheng kuo: Yeahth, it's a push.\nJeremy Ross: You sent it.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, but yeah, this is because like cloudco wrote this pr, I was like, it's very detailed.\nyusheng kuo: Like, if I wrote the pr, it would be just like, one line.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: I was like, is this report?\nJeremy Ross: And then I didn't have time to read it.\nJeremy Ross: I was just like, why?\nJeremy Ross: Why am I getting so much?\nJeremy Ross: Is it because I'm watching it?\nJeremy Ross: I'm watching that repo.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nJeremy Ross: That's why I received this.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Because you are the owner and then default anyone who open the pr, you will get there.\nyusheng kuo: Like, I.\nyusheng kuo: When I commit, you don't get it, but when I create a pr, you will get it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Doctor Means, like, I. I want to request you to merge my branch into main.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: So when you make edits, what do you plan on editing?\nJeremy Ross: I mean, is it just adding new agents to it or, like, what do you.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I didn't touch your part.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: I was gonna say, as long as it's adding and it's not editing.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, My stuff.\nyusheng kuo: That's.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Totally fine.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then that's the.\nyusheng kuo: Ideally, that won't cause, like, merge conflict.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's a term for, like, when I added something and then you are also adding something and then we both try to merge.\nyusheng kuo: There will be a merge conflict.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: No, dude, I used to work at Launchdarkly.\nJeremy Ross: I worked there for two years.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nJeremy Ross: That was my pitch.\nJeremy Ross: I'm all about the merge conflicts.\nJeremy Ross: I get it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nJeremy Ross: So do you want me to show you where I got lost, or do you want to, like, dive into your.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, totally.\nyusheng kuo: Totally.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Don't forget what you're gonna say, but, yeah, I'm happy to show you where.\nJeremy Ross: I kind of.\nJeremy Ross: Like, I didn't have much time to really dig into it, but.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's perfect.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Just a bummer because they seemed so interested, but it was at, like, the very end of the call, so I didn't really have time anyways, so I got to this point to where I was like, okay, I connected the repo and I see my eight agents.\nJeremy Ross: That's exactly right.\nJeremy Ross: And then I clicked into one and I was like, okay.\nJeremy Ross: Like, it shows you the information.\nJeremy Ross: I don't really.\nJeremy Ross: The prompt here is, like, entry point.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: So, like, if you sense a web hook, the web hook would essentially fill the payload, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yes, yes.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: So do you have anything else?\nJeremy Ross: Is it just one payload, or could it be multiple?\nyusheng kuo: For now it's just one payload because, like, your one webhook can only send, like, one payload, right?\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nJeremy Ross: But it could be as long as you want, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Is it like a whole JSON body?\nyusheng kuo: Well, I think typical webhook also have a.\nyusheng kuo: Most of them have like a body like limit.\nyusheng kuo: Otherwise they will trigger some like.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, the body data is too big.\nyusheng kuo: So you couldn't send the whole gigabytes of data through payload.\nJeremy Ross: Oh, you can.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: I don't think you can.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, because they will overload the network.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: The better way is like you send like typically how?\nyusheng kuo: Email.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like agent mail, for example.\nyusheng kuo: When they have an attachment, the send the URL.\nyusheng kuo: So each of like a client side create the URL to save it.\nyusheng kuo: The server side also get only the URL to pull it.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so it's not like through the webhook.\nyusheng kuo: That's the better way.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So if you plan to send large data, send the URL like R2.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: No, that.\nJeremy Ross: That makes sense.\nJeremy Ross: Okay, so one question I had while it's top of mind here was at the top.\nJeremy Ross: Shoot.\nJeremy Ross: Where is it?\nJeremy Ross: Was I looking at.\nJeremy Ross: Oh, this part, you know how it says like it'll be sent through as Claude dash P. Right.\nJeremy Ross: It's like a parallel agent.\nyusheng kuo: P is prompt.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, okay, that's a good point.\nyusheng kuo: People like me, I use cloud so nicely.\nyusheng kuo: So this is literally what we would use.\nyusheng kuo: If you want to do headless.\nyusheng kuo: Headless cloud code, which means you don't see the cloud interface or in like a tui, the terminal ui, you can do cloud P. Yeah, but that's like.\nJeremy Ross: For parallel, doesn't it?\nyusheng kuo: No, I think.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, okay.\nyusheng kuo: Maybe you're right.\nyusheng kuo: I mean, let's try to.\nyusheng kuo: What?\nJeremy Ross: Actually, what.\nJeremy Ross: What you just described is what I meant.\nJeremy Ross: But.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But I think dash V is.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, I mean, why?\nyusheng kuo: Because it's.\nyusheng kuo: It's a variable.\nJeremy Ross: I think it's just.\nJeremy Ross: You can do that no matter what.\nJeremy Ross: You don't have to do dash B.\nyusheng kuo: Really?\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Pretty sure I could be wrong.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: We.\nyusheng kuo: We both run.\nJeremy Ross: Really Print.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's print response.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that makes sense.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: You were closer then anyways.\nyusheng kuo: No, no, no.\nJeremy Ross: You're printing it as the prompt as the first thing that it says, aren't you?\nyusheng kuo: No, you're printing the result out to the standard IO which is like your terminal.\nyusheng kuo: Otherwise you won't see anything.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: If I actually complete something but doesn't show out.\nJeremy Ross: I think that we are over complicating it.\nJeremy Ross: Let's not.\nJeremy Ross: I don't think we should mention this, but I do think that we should give people the option to Change this to a.\nJeremy Ross: Was it dangerously?\nJeremy Ross: No permissions, something like that.\nJeremy Ross: Isn't that what it's called?\nJeremy Ross: Okay, yeah, like give them a few of the options.\nJeremy Ross: Because to me, I mean, wouldn't that just append something to the end of this?\nJeremy Ross: And it shouldn't be that much of a.\nJeremy Ross: An engineering lift.\nJeremy Ross: But I mean, I'll leave that up to you.\nJeremy Ross: I'm just saying that like some people will not want to have to deal with constant emails coming through and have to babysit an agent.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So now it's actually default is skipped dangerously.\nyusheng kuo: So unless you explicitly say hey, like, like either in your agent file or in your skill, say hey, you have to ask me.\nyusheng kuo: Otherwise it would just like for any tool it would just go through.\nyusheng kuo: Otherwise it would be constantly like asking you for like a tool approval.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Okay, let's just leave it then.\nJeremy Ross: Let's see if anyone complains or like what the feedback is.\nJeremy Ross: That's fine.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Because typically the idea is typically when you try to deploy, you kind of know you want to let you do things.\nyusheng kuo: Otherwise you would probably do in interactive mode.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nJeremy Ross: 100%.\nJeremy Ross: Another thing that I was hoping we could add is.\nyusheng kuo: But before you move on.\nyusheng kuo: So what do you think would be the better way to describe in the entry problem?\nyusheng kuo: It would be make you feel like, oh, I know what it is.\nJeremy Ross: I mean it's pretty straightforward.\nJeremy Ross: Maybe say like.\nyusheng kuo: No, no, you already get polluted.\nJeremy Ross: Okay, maybe maybe say in parenthesis say like this is the first thing or this is what will be said to the agent to initiate the, the call.\nJeremy Ross: Something like that.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, okay, okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Firefly, take notes.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: So and actually I'm using the notion thing.\nJeremy Ross: So I just downloaded notion and it just popped up.\nJeremy Ross: Like they record all the calls without even telling.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, nice.\nJeremy Ross: But anyway, so yeah, I think that's fine.\nJeremy Ross: This is good.\nJeremy Ross: I think that it's not clear enough how to do the.\nJeremy Ross: The web hook one where like okay, it says web hook settings.\nJeremy Ross: Sure.\nJeremy Ross: But like what does that mean?\nJeremy Ross: And then it's asking.\nyusheng kuo: Oh yeah, good point.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Because this is called web host setting.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: It should be called like configure secret.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Just this is like semantically not cohesive here.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, not at all.\nJeremy Ross: Not at all.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, yeah, like create pull, request examples.\nyusheng kuo: Nothing to do with.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, let me think about.\nyusheng kuo: You know, I'm kind of like a half by coded for the front empire.\nyusheng kuo: At least.\nyusheng kuo: We should.\nyusheng kuo: So the way you set.\nyusheng kuo: So you need to set up the secret.\nyusheng kuo: If you are like, if you're like, this cloud code is using some like, for example, HubSpot API key.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Then you need to give it so.\nJeremy Ross: You can add as many as you want.\nJeremy Ross: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: For example, you need a cloud code API key or oauth token at least to run.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So I think we probably should show people how to do cloud co oauth token so that you can bring your own subscription token here.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, we should like have a hyperlink.\nJeremy Ross: To show and then actually here's one.\nJeremy Ross: Yes, I think so, too.\nJeremy Ross: Like a hyperlink to show you where to get your anthropic, but also where to get your claude code.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, so good.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, There's a instruction in our doc.\nyusheng kuo: We can lead people to the dock so people can see through the doc.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nJeremy Ross: So like, there should be a description that says insert any API keys for the tools you want.\nJeremy Ross: Something like that.\nJeremy Ross: And then, like, it should also say, like, at a bare minimum, you need at least anthropic or claude code token.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Here.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Right, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then so we're running on your token.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Now is it automatically added the.\nyusheng kuo: If you have one?\nyusheng kuo: Yes, yes.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so if you set one, it.\nJeremy Ross: Will be automatically added, but will it appear here?\nJeremy Ross: Yes, it will.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: You would prioritize the API key, but you can, like delete that and then like add the cloud co token.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: All right.\nJeremy Ross: And so what I was hoping.\nJeremy Ross: All right, it says create pull requests.\nJeremy Ross: So automatically create a full request.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, so that's.\nJeremy Ross: That's good, I think.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, it's good.\nJeremy Ross: Oh, no, I think it's good.\nJeremy Ross: Like, really?\nJeremy Ross: I think that I would not shorten it like that.\nJeremy Ross: A pr.\nJeremy Ross: Just assume people don't.\nJeremy Ross: Like they're just now learning how to code.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nJeremy Ross: Maybe spell that out.\nJeremy Ross: But also you could say, you could change this.\nJeremy Ross: Maybe put pull request in parenthesis or something.\nJeremy Ross: But I think the way you describe, not create branch, but write results back to GitHub, then in parenthesis or down here it can say automatically create a pull request after it completes, you know.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, okay.\nJeremy Ross: You're like, just be explicit because right now you're just saying the same thing twice.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nJeremy Ross: And then if you say, like, you describe what a pull request is by saying right, it writes back to GitHub.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Like it's way easier to click.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, I agree.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Now let me scroll down.\nJeremy Ross: And so I was expecting to see something really obvious around, like, okay, what is the input going to be?\nJeremy Ross: Is it going to be schedule?\nJeremy Ross: I don't see anywhere to schedule.\nJeremy Ross: Is it going to be web hook?\nJeremy Ross: I don't see anywhere to say this is a web hook agent.\nJeremy Ross: Is it going to be like something else?\nJeremy Ross: I don't even know what that would be like manual or.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So the way is.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, let's try.\nyusheng kuo: So if you hit that deploy agent.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's okay.\nyusheng kuo: You don't have it.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, okay.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's like.\nJeremy Ross: Well, how do I find this Claude code OAuth.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So you go to cloud.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: You don't need to show me.\nyusheng kuo: Then you sorry, don't go in there, just go to terminal.\nJeremy Ross: So what I did was I just told it give me the Claude code oauth token.\nyusheng kuo: Did it gave you.\nJeremy Ross: I think it's going to.\nJeremy Ross: Let's see.\nyusheng kuo: Really?\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So you should go out exit or you can open another like the terminal interface and just type in this, this cloud setup bash token.\nJeremy Ross: Okay, let's see.\nyusheng kuo: Well, okay, so he can like I.\nJeremy Ross: Don'T see it and it's not stored anywhere and blah, blah, blah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So because it's like if you don't set up, you don't, you won't have it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's actually a wave.\nJeremy Ross: Got it.\nJeremy Ross: Okay, I see what you're saying.\nJeremy Ross: All right, so I'm in the terminal.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: And then I do what?\nyusheng kuo: Just type in cloud and space setup token.\nyusheng kuo: It should generate oauth token.\nyusheng kuo: Make sure you need to have the same like name of your API key like the cloud coke.\nyusheng kuo: You just copy the thing.\nyusheng kuo: Did you see?\nJeremy Ross: Looks like it's working.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, this like there needs to be a button next to it that you click on in the UI of datagen and it just shows you some screenshots and says cli, type this and then it'll show you this.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, yeah, good point.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: At least the bare minimum we should have a link to show people how to do it.\nJeremy Ross: So yeah, it says what would you like to set up?\nyusheng kuo: I don't know why.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, so it says a new project development environment, Claude code and something else.\nyusheng kuo: What can you show me?\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: It looks like it's working.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's how they do like slack or like GitHub review.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I think this is like a huge benefit because like a 200 of token worth like few, I don't know, a few thousand dollars of API key.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then once you have that you just go to secret and set it.\nJeremy Ross: Okay, I'm just reading through this real quick.\nyusheng kuo: What are you Doing there?\nyusheng kuo: I. I set up two meetings with two agents.\nyusheng kuo: Two agency like GTM Engineer.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, those are like a run and they want to run some like brainstorm session.\nyusheng kuo: So it would be kind of cool to see.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: They are both interested like in claying car co with clay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: One of them.\nyusheng kuo: I show you one is Andre Androidly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: What's the name of the.\nJeremy Ross: The agency?\nyusheng kuo: I think they are like a small one.\nyusheng kuo: One is like demand Automation.\nyusheng kuo: I think he's like a solo.\nyusheng kuo: One of them is solo now, like freelance.\nyusheng kuo: The other one is joining they call Avocado.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know like how big it is, but yeah, both of them, like one is more new newbie type of engineer.\nyusheng kuo: The others have been kind of playing hard around cloud code and already using cloud co.\nyusheng kuo: Both of them.\nyusheng kuo: When I try to like show people how to use cloudco and like we.\nyusheng kuo: We kind of gained touch.\nyusheng kuo: So.\nJeremy Ross: Awesome.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, You shouldn't go here.\nyusheng kuo: You should Control C. Control C. Do twice to get out.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Again, do twice.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So just type cloud setup token like the one I sent you.\nyusheng kuo: Space set up.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I did the dash.\nyusheng kuo: Set up.\nyusheng kuo: Dash token.\nJeremy Ross: Oh, oh, oh, oh, sure.\nJeremy Ross: Like this?\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, yeah, got it.\nyusheng kuo: So just enter.\nJeremy Ross: All right.\nyusheng kuo: It will ask you to sign.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Okay, Let me run through this.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Well, that was a lot easier.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Need a screenshot.\nJeremy Ross: You just need to put that there.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nJeremy Ross: It's like copy it.\nJeremy Ross: Like one of those copy boxes.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But you have to mention like, oh, it has to be outside of the cloud.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: People, that's something.\nyusheng kuo: It's really.\nyusheng kuo: It's really, really important.\nyusheng kuo: I feel for this, at least this generation of product to be easy to use.\nyusheng kuo: I think because everything is so hard to use now.\nyusheng kuo: Even mcp.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: It's like damn hard to add.\nyusheng kuo: Look at your iPhone.\nyusheng kuo: Like how easy to add an app.\nyusheng kuo: It's like one of the hardest thing to add MCP at first.\nyusheng kuo: Like every different client have a different way to install and almost no one's like one click a cloud.\nyusheng kuo: You have to like do something there.\nJeremy Ross: Yep, I have noticed.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So anything that string this kind of simplicity will be able to gain the market.\nyusheng kuo: That's.\nyusheng kuo: I think that's my point.\nyusheng kuo: Like technically you can do us like deploy a whole face API or whatever, create a model AI and even model AI, I don't think you can do like MCP tool.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's.\nyusheng kuo: It's pain neck.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: That's why I feel like if we do it right, We will be very useful.\nyusheng kuo: So I, I think I'm thinking of two strategies.\nyusheng kuo: One is we should go platform neutral.\nyusheng kuo: So now it's cloud code because CloudCo has the most comprehensive thing.\nyusheng kuo: But eventually like the flash skill will be.\nyusheng kuo: Now it's going to be the, the, the, the common thing.\nyusheng kuo: So I'm going to support skill.\nyusheng kuo: So not everyone has agent, but everyone has skill.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Codex has skill, the cursor have skill, Gemini have skill.\nyusheng kuo: And then they are all in the same folder, only cloud is like in dot cloud slash agent.\nyusheng kuo: The other is all like die agent IMD or like die agent slash skills.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so that, that's the first thing we can go platform neutral.\nyusheng kuo: Actually I think OpenAI Codex is pretty good.\nyusheng kuo: I actually use Codex a lot in coding now.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, I was using it the last few days.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's actually more.\nJeremy Ross: It's really good.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it is.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And it's cheap.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's way cheaper.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So that's first thing.\nyusheng kuo: The second thing is just like building around this kind of whole infrastructure layer, right?\nyusheng kuo: Like deployment, tooling, adding tool is so pain act.\nyusheng kuo: We make it easy like one click or add whatever MCP you want.\nyusheng kuo: We want to make it one click by adding a lot like preexisting so you don't need to.\nyusheng kuo: We also include the registry there like a directory so you can one click and then actually it's probably you can even deploy the MCP server on us easily.\nyusheng kuo: We kind of have the tool already.\nJeremy Ross: Definitely.\nyusheng kuo: Also because our custom tool is actually kind of really synergy.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: You can like oh, this thing.\nyusheng kuo: I really want it to be deterministic.\nyusheng kuo: I can just deploy the tool and then no one can touch it and then the skill and then the resource.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like your memory can actually.\nyusheng kuo: All your data can actually be stored here.\nyusheng kuo: And because there's a very important concept in MCP is actually resource.\nyusheng kuo: So resource is kind of like a hard drive, like a storage.\nyusheng kuo: So you can continue to like upload your CSV, whatever in your resource and then you can use resource to pass like different format of file, not just text and yeah, and then of course like skill.\nyusheng kuo: So eventually we could just be the infrastructure layer of like cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: For now I think we can just say cloud code so we can kind of cut through the noise.\nyusheng kuo: But eventually I think it will be the agent infrastructure.\nyusheng kuo: The thing I'm worrying is, which we don't need to now is how odd is this is such a obvious next thing, right?\nyusheng kuo: Like what the lab would do if they see a bunch of people like trying to deploy cloud code, right?\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, I'm sure they're on it already, man.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, we have to move quickly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: We need to like learn user behavior.\nyusheng kuo: One thing is like we've been very opinionated about it, so we make it super easy.\nyusheng kuo: Like we only allow like MCP on us, Right?\nyusheng kuo: So they make it out.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, but that's something we need to think about.\nyusheng kuo: How do we.\nyusheng kuo: You know, it's just like.\nyusheng kuo: No, there's an AI world.\nyusheng kuo: There's no real application layer can be immune.\nyusheng kuo: Like just look at Harvey.\nyusheng kuo: Oh yeah, the car code.\nyusheng kuo: Just like cloud, just open there.\nyusheng kuo: The whole legal thing.\nyusheng kuo: And there was a time there's a lot of AI for Excel.\nyusheng kuo: They are all in trouble now.\nyusheng kuo: Cloud, just open there.\nJeremy Ross: Well, I don't know actually I just used it earlier tonight and it sucks.\nJeremy Ross: Like it's.\nJeremy Ross: It can barely do anything.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but it's just like some easy problems and it'll.\nJeremy Ross: But it's.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, but, but I just like, just for example, like there.\nyusheng kuo: There are still a lot of like browser automation company nowadays, right?\nyusheng kuo: A gently browser.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, but like the speed of like cloud, because of the speed of the data they can collect and then they can train their own model to fine tune it.\nJeremy Ross: Oh, it's cloud in the desktop or in the.\nJeremy Ross: In the browser is insane.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So like, like earlier, earlier the computer user was barely useful.\nJeremy Ross: Oh, I know.\nyusheng kuo: And then now, now they can like.\nJeremy Ross: No, dude, it spins up tools.\nJeremy Ross: It spins up JavaScript tools to inspect your traffic.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, yeah, I used it to reverse engineer clay.\nJeremy Ross: I was like.\nJeremy Ross: I just said this was after I did it actually.\nJeremy Ross: But I just wanted to see can Claude do it?\nJeremy Ross: So I said like poke around on this site and use a bunch of the features and then track the API network.\nJeremy Ross: And it gave me just a full on docs.\nJeremy Ross: The docs don't exist.\nJeremy Ross: But I was blown away.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Anyways, so I just saw.\nJeremy Ross: I click deploy and I can see now I can go to schedule undeploy.\nJeremy Ross: That's great.\nJeremy Ross: You've got the web hook URL.\nJeremy Ross: Awesome.\nyusheng kuo: And you can do Run now, which is manual.\nJeremy Ross: And then.\nJeremy Ross: Yes.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, perfect.\nJeremy Ross: And then.\nJeremy Ross: So Run now will just send whatever you type in down here or what will it do?\nyusheng kuo: So you can try.\nyusheng kuo: You can take a look.\nyusheng kuo: I would.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: What would you do?\nJeremy Ross: Let's see.\nJeremy Ross: This is an activity context.\nJeremy Ross: I would just say like.\nJeremy Ross: Oh, wait, it says it needs a payload.\nyusheng kuo: No, it's a.\nyusheng kuo: It's a.\nyusheng kuo: It's missing.\nyusheng kuo: So you said that there's no.\nyusheng kuo: It's a Warning.\nJeremy Ross: So here's the thing is like these reports don't actually need an input.\nJeremy Ross: So it could just be like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's the purpose of entry prompt.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: So like please run the agent block, blah, blah, blah.\nJeremy Ross: So like that.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, so that would be the input.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Right.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: And then I'll save that and then let's see.\nJeremy Ross: There's really.\nJeremy Ross: No, this is all just to see.\nyusheng kuo: But it's just description.\nJeremy Ross: No.\nJeremy Ross: Okay, that's fine.\nJeremy Ross: Now it seems to me like you can make agents extremely easy here and just have it pushed to your GitHub.\nJeremy Ross: Is that true?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Oh, wait, is that a next step that you're trying to do?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, that would.\nyusheng kuo: But we, we were not sure.\nyusheng kuo: Like, but then you don't, you don't have a test loop here, but you could, right?\nyusheng kuo: You could just like let it run.\nJeremy Ross: You want to make it easy, dude.\nJeremy Ross: So like here's.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, is that you have a version of this tool where, I mean, obviously it would push through as like a pull requests or whatever.\nJeremy Ross: Maybe you could guide people through that.\nJeremy Ross: Or maybe it's like, yeah, click here to commit warning it will go straight to your main branch, blah, blah, blah.\nJeremy Ross: But like you commit it directly.\nJeremy Ross: And then.\nJeremy Ross: So like I would say like, I want to use data gen to spin up random agents and then.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, you mean not even in Cloud.\nJeremy Ross: Co. No, and then like have it pushed into my, my repo.\nJeremy Ross: So yeah, yeah, playground here in the top left.\nJeremy Ross: I want to use Claude, you know, Claude AI for it and just be able to vibe code agents and test agents right there in the chat.\nyusheng kuo: Dude.\nJeremy Ross: Like, have it deployed.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, you don't even need to go to cloud.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nJeremy Ross: The iterative loop there is wild.\nJeremy Ross: Like.\nJeremy Ross: Like I've.\nJeremy Ross: I've never even considered doing something like that.\nJeremy Ross: And the thought of it is.\nJeremy Ross: It's pretty exciting, honestly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Because like creating agent here can be quite straightforward.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, I think just one.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, we definitely start here and then like when we talk to people and when you have those conversations, like tell them that idea and ask them if that's something that would get them excited about this.\nJeremy Ross: Because like people, people, they want Claude code, but they do not want to maintain it.\nJeremy Ross: I've noticed, like, that's some of the combos I've had.\nJeremy Ross: Like, they get overwhelmed with it.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, I would say Cal code still, like, for example, like navigating it is still not easy.\nyusheng kuo: You still need a good ui.\nyusheng kuo: Like it's powerful but like it's, it's two single modality.\nyusheng kuo: Like I don't.\nyusheng kuo: I couldn't even like go to like, like.\nyusheng kuo: Have you tried the new Codex app on desktop?\nJeremy Ross: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so they have a really nice thing.\nyusheng kuo: It's like you can go to their plan, right?\nyusheng kuo: Or like a.\nyusheng kuo: Like, like like edit and you can comment like a co review on that then.\nyusheng kuo: And then it would just like only update that.\nyusheng kuo: That's like huge for me.\nyusheng kuo: Like for example, you, when you, when you see the plan, right.\nyusheng kuo: You only want to update this plan.\nyusheng kuo: Now you can only like a type say hey, I want them update.\nyusheng kuo: And then you have to copy and paste that part into the cloud code chat.\nyusheng kuo: Say hey, I want to modify this part to this part of the plan.\nyusheng kuo: And then in Codex you can just go there and then like click command and then say I want to change this.\nyusheng kuo: And then they know the context there they.\nyusheng kuo: You only want to change this part so it's like way easier.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, dude, I think so too.\nJeremy Ross: It's.\nJeremy Ross: It was really cool and like the stuff that I've been struggling with with some code for a while.\nJeremy Ross: I just put it on Codex and it finished it immediately.\nJeremy Ross: Like first.\nJeremy Ross: First shot like.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah yeah yeah Claude.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's way slower.\nyusheng kuo: So now I still go in both.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, but because like, but.\nyusheng kuo: But it's just really thoroughly restuffed.\nyusheng kuo: He really restart.\nyusheng kuo: He doesn't like it abruptly.\nyusheng kuo: Like it just goes to stuff.\nyusheng kuo: He really re.\nyusheng kuo: Even.\nyusheng kuo: Even the.\nyusheng kuo: The open clause.\nyusheng kuo: Well call that box.\nyusheng kuo: Use the author.\nyusheng kuo: Say he now is connection most not doing in code Codex not cloud code anymore.\nyusheng kuo: Because like Codex is more.\nyusheng kuo: Well he said like he distributed but.\nyusheng kuo: But because Codex are so, so good at like reading the file compared to Calco.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So now if you, if you run this because you don't have that variable there, right.\nyusheng kuo: So it's actually not going to put in any of this.\nyusheng kuo: So it can be empty.\nyusheng kuo: It could be anything.\nyusheng kuo: It doesn't matter.\nJeremy Ross: But what would this be?\nJeremy Ross: I don't really understand what it's trying to say.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, so this would just.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, just be the adjacent parallel.\nyusheng kuo: Like say.\nyusheng kuo: Say if you have the payload in your potential prompt, this will be the input like your manual run.\nJeremy Ross: Why do I need to see this?\nyusheng kuo: Well, you can test like one way is first you can test your.\nyusheng kuo: Your cloud code like your your run here or you can just like just ignore that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: The reason we we have that is because like say I I'm.\nyusheng kuo: The Firefly is coming in with some, some payload.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: But sometimes it's hard to ask Firefly to create a payload for Me to test it like Firefly, you have to create a payload or like a.\nyusheng kuo: Hey, Rich.\nyusheng kuo: Like the payload only happened or I can only see the payload when the webhook get triggered.\nyusheng kuo: But how do I test it so I can actually paste the whole payload into here to test my agent Even I didn't get the payload.\nyusheng kuo: Incoming payload from the.\nJeremy Ross: Okay, so, but this is.\nJeremy Ross: This is something that.\nJeremy Ross: This is aligned to that thing that I typed in earlier, that other text box, right?\nJeremy Ross: That.\nJeremy Ross: That would be here, wouldn't it?\nJeremy Ross: Or no, I just don't.\nJeremy Ross: I don't understand why I wouldn't just like, should I have put something different in that other box and then actually put the.\nJeremy Ross: The.\nJeremy Ross: The example or like the test here?\nyusheng kuo: Either way, they will all be sent into as a part of the.\nyusheng kuo: This whole JSON payload will be saying if you include that double.\nyusheng kuo: So the whole payload will be just part of the prompt.\nJeremy Ross: Wait, so this is appended to that other text box?\nJeremy Ross: Is that what you're saying?\nyusheng kuo: If you include a payload.\nyusheng kuo: So this is a variable of the payload, for example.\nyusheng kuo: So let me go back.\nJeremy Ross: I'm confused now.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So if you don't include the payload, Right.\nyusheng kuo: So the payload is not here.\nyusheng kuo: The.\nyusheng kuo: The.\nyusheng kuo: You think of the.\nyusheng kuo: Like, in Clay, you have this like variable, right?\nyusheng kuo: Like a company name.\nyusheng kuo: But if your prom doesn't have prom company name there, then like your prom doesn't have this variable.\nyusheng kuo: Regardless what company variables value is, it won't be sent into your prompt.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Like if it is, you will have like a two duplicated halo now.\nJeremy Ross: Okay, so you can add as many as you want.\nJeremy Ross: But it doesn't.\nJeremy Ross: So I'm just still having trouble.\nJeremy Ross: And then like this says format and it doesn't do anything when you click it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, because it's already formatted.\nyusheng kuo: But if you don't like for somebody delete one of the.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: But it doesn't fix it.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: You just like.\nyusheng kuo: Wait, who doesn't?\nyusheng kuo: I guess you only do the format.\nyusheng kuo: It doesn't do like a fixed format.\nyusheng kuo: What if you enter.\nyusheng kuo: What if you enter the.\nyusheng kuo: The after the.\nyusheng kuo: The.\nyusheng kuo: The.\nyusheng kuo: What's that called?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Okay, let's fix it.\nJeremy Ross: But then like, if you do that.\nJeremy Ross: Oh, it worked this time.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, I guess it is because like, he doesn't know what that means.\nyusheng kuo: Like if it's like this, it's like it doesn't know what actually you want to do.\nyusheng kuo: Is that because you miss ink sample or you miss key?\nyusheng kuo: You know what I mean?\nyusheng kuo: There's no single answer for this because this is a deterministicity formatting.\nyusheng kuo: So if you create that it will be confusing.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: It's because your examples underscore didn't get formatted with another field name or like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so it only fixed if it's like obvious answer.\nJeremy Ross: Okay, so all right, so if you want to use something like this with an agent, do you should put in the agent itself in the instructions you would say you will receive or like look for these five types of data points and use those like execute on those.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Now why I'm just wondering like since it is all just based on prompts, why really do you need this versus just telling people to use this format here with the curly brackets.\nyusheng kuo: When you run manual, if it's a curly bracket means it's a value that be filled at the runtime.\nyusheng kuo: You can have the same prompt format here.\nyusheng kuo: It's like a prompt template.\nyusheng kuo: This is like a prompt template.\nyusheng kuo: Then you can actually trigger that with different value of your payload.\nJeremy Ross: Okay, so all right, maybe I'm.\nJeremy Ross: I'm getting you now.\nJeremy Ross: So when someone triggers this agent through webhook, they need to have something that matches this.\nJeremy Ross: It's a run now, so it would.\nyusheng kuo: No, no, he doesn't need to.\nyusheng kuo: This is only for tested.\nJeremy Ross: But I'm saying like when you send it through, does their.\nJeremy Ross: Does their value need to be in this case payload one, payload two, payload three.\nyusheng kuo: So there is no payload two, payload three.\nyusheng kuo: There's only accepting payload.\nJeremy Ross: So it's just one, one thing.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: We should, we should, we should, we should like throw it in air if they see curly bracket.\nyusheng kuo: But with other variables you definitely should.\nJeremy Ross: Because that feels like a natural thing that you could just add as many as you want.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: The reason we don't have many is the payload itself should take care of that one.\nyusheng kuo: Webhook can only send one body.\nyusheng kuo: You can think like a payload is the body.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So you won't get like a two body in one API call.\nJeremy Ross: Right.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: So in this case like it'll always be payload as the.\nJeremy Ross: Like this word here.\nJeremy Ross: It'll always be whatever.\nyusheng kuo: No, no, no, no, no.\nyusheng kuo: It would be.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Actually, let me actually give you an example.\nyusheng kuo: Let me.\nyusheng kuo: Let me try to show just.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Share my screen.\nyusheng kuo: It will be probably easier if I give you.\nyusheng kuo: But that's a good thing that get confused.\nyusheng kuo: So can you see my screen?\nJeremy Ross: It's kind of blurry.\nyusheng kuo: So just like it would take a bit of time.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Why'd you take it away?\nJeremy Ross: Now it's going to reset.\nyusheng kuo: Let Me do it again.\nJeremy Ross: How late do your kids sleep in in the morning?\nyusheng kuo: The little one actually sleep until 10.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: He recently saw too like you know, I don't know my.\nyusheng kuo: My kid when they were the like the older one too.\nyusheng kuo: Like they are just a time they kind of really random like they were like he sleep the nap time until like 6 and then just start to wake up and like super energetic and super hard to fall asleep.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Can you see my screen now?\nJeremy Ross: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So here is the payload that Firefly was sent into us.\nyusheng kuo: So you can see there is a different feel.\nyusheng kuo: So the whole thing is the payload.\nJeremy Ross: I see.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Now so they can only send one payload per request.\nyusheng kuo: So there's no like a two payload.\nyusheng kuo: So if they want to send like a nasty thing, which is rare because like typically the API try to be simple.\nyusheng kuo: They will have like something here and another JSON format here.\nJeremy Ross: Now you can't have anything nested basically.\nyusheng kuo: I think you can, but that's not recommended because sometimes the.\nyusheng kuo: For us it doesn't matter.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: But from my understanding most of the payload.\nyusheng kuo: Oh actually it does.\nyusheng kuo: Like hey, Rich's payload is like super big dictionary.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know if I have that here.\nyusheng kuo: Like entry.\nyusheng kuo: Let me see if I. Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: See this is actually what the payload.\nyusheng kuo: Actually the.\nyusheng kuo: The.\nyusheng kuo: The Hay Rich sending is huge.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know if you can see it.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, no, that's a lot.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so that's actually what I use.\nyusheng kuo: Like when I actually get the real payload from Hay Reach, I use this to test my.\nyusheng kuo: I was like, okay, I updated my agent.\nyusheng kuo: I want to try to see what is.\nyusheng kuo: Actually I can just like do run now and then just like copy and paste this and format it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So this is actually.\nyusheng kuo: You can see exactly the whole.\nyusheng kuo: It's really not recommended.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know why they are doing that.\nyusheng kuo: I personally think, hey Rich have pretty poor API team.\nJeremy Ross: Quick dude.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But you can see this actually can be whole schema, very complicated schema.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: And this whole thing will just be sent into the payload.\nJeremy Ross: So why do you want to enforce the format?\nJeremy Ross: Do you feel like that?\nJeremy Ross: Some of these agents would have a tool call as their first step and this would be the.\nJeremy Ross: The input for that tool call.\nyusheng kuo: So the reason that we want to have this is because like I said, like I want to make it as like a task thing.\nyusheng kuo: Like I can run.\nyusheng kuo: So I wanted to.\nyusheng kuo: I want it to be similar to when there's a real web coming in.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: How the agent will respond yeah, I'm getting it now.\nJeremy Ross: So the payload, it'll always be payload.\nJeremy Ross: I think maybe.\nyusheng kuo: Change the name.\nyusheng kuo: But yeah, payload is quite.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, yeah, just add rules.\nJeremy Ross: Just add rules where it.\nJeremy Ross: Anything inside curly brackets can only say payload.\nJeremy Ross: Also, there can only be one curly bracketed thing there or like one that says payload.\nJeremy Ross: That's it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: And like just a little helper.\nJeremy Ross: Helper pop up.\nJeremy Ross: And then.\nJeremy Ross: So the idea when you run an agent inside datagen, it's always what it seems like to me you're saying is that when you run it here manually, it's because you're testing it.\nJeremy Ross: It's because you're a few.\nJeremy Ross: One off test and then you want to let it ride.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Okay, cool.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, because like, like for example, in schedule, right?\nyusheng kuo: You don't need the payload because you don't typically have, like in schedule, you don't have a way to send a variable at the runtime.\nyusheng kuo: The runtime is when you schedule.\nyusheng kuo: You can only have a default value.\nyusheng kuo: You couldn't just change the input variable every time you schedule.\nJeremy Ross: Well, the default value should be.\nyusheng kuo: But if it's a default value, like what to do?\nJeremy Ross: Basically.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that would just be the entry prompt.\nyusheng kuo: Basically.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, whatever.\nyusheng kuo: Your entry problem would just be the final value of your problem.\nyusheng kuo: It's just like a. Repeat that problem over again.\nyusheng kuo: But for webhook, every time it can be different.\nJeremy Ross: Yes.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: So when there is no prompt or.\nJeremy Ross: Sorry, when there is no payload in curly brackets.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I typically actually what I do, like for schedule job and I want to do like manual run to test it.\nyusheng kuo: I typically just do this.\nyusheng kuo: It's just like empty.\nyusheng kuo: Or I simply just remove the payload.\nyusheng kuo: I actually just remove the payload in the entry prompt.\nyusheng kuo: So it doesn't matter what I put here.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: So maybe think through what it looks like to not have the payload in that initial message so that this part does not stop people and confuse them.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: What?\nyusheng kuo: What, what?\nyusheng kuo: What?\nyusheng kuo: Actually, what you thought, what, what you thought it was like when you see this.\nJeremy Ross: So I thought, I really.\nJeremy Ross: At first, I didn't know what to think because I was assuming that like this sort of thing is handled by just typing in what I wanted in the earlier step and that I would not have to paste in anything else after that.\nJeremy Ross: But maybe that's only because I already deleted payload.\nJeremy Ross: Right.\nJeremy Ross: So I was not expecting to see anything like that.\nJeremy Ross: So I was having trouble connecting it.\nJeremy Ross: So in that case, it's about like covering this edge case.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, one second, Sorry, one Second, I need to take my kid for a bit.\nyusheng kuo: Just give me one, one minute.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, sorry.\nyusheng kuo: We were potty training him and.\nyusheng kuo: And he just pee on the sofa, so.\nJeremy Ross: Nice.\nJeremy Ross: Love that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, Especially like so far.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Of course, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Not floor.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, well, yesterday it was on floor, so it's fine.\nyusheng kuo: But wooden floor, not carpet.\nJeremy Ross: So we, I guess we ended up putting like covers and like plastic and stuff on our furniture at one point.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, our so far has been like a lot of history.\nyusheng kuo: So we find he puke on that everything.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Nice.\nJeremy Ross: Of course, the stains, the reminders.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: So that's something that we need to improve.\nyusheng kuo: But yeah, once you hit it, you should be able to start to run now.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, I started to see it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Now, okay, here's one thing.\nJeremy Ross: You go to run now and then does that like if you set a schedule, does that execute the schedule or does that only do a test.\nyusheng kuo: Run now?\nyusheng kuo: What do you mean?\nyusheng kuo: Like, so run now.\nyusheng kuo: It will run now.\nyusheng kuo: Like.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, yeah, no, I get that.\nJeremy Ross: But so you were saying.\nJeremy Ross: So, all right, right now what I'm saying is that the run now button is set up sort of like a test now.\nJeremy Ross: Yes, like a test run button.\nJeremy Ross: Right.\nJeremy Ross: But it's confusing on whether or not that initiates the schedule.\nyusheng kuo: Like, oh, okay.\nJeremy Ross: And then.\nJeremy Ross: Okay, you set it.\nJeremy Ross: Can you just set it to whatever and then I guess delete it?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And you can do cron recurring.\nyusheng kuo: We didn't do that.\nyusheng kuo: So that we should remove cron.\nyusheng kuo: Well.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, oh, I saw Chron is too technical.\nJeremy Ross: No, no, dude.\nJeremy Ross: Oh, you mean the word?\nJeremy Ross: The word?\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, it does say recurring.\nJeremy Ross: You can just leave it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So you can also schedule one time.\nyusheng kuo: Like say I only do want to do one time like in two days.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, you can also do that.\nJeremy Ross: That's fine.\nJeremy Ross: That makes sense.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: All right, let's hit next.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then it will be every hour or every day at like, this is like a not best wording.\nyusheng kuo: It's like, because it could be like every hour, but it could also be like eight at like a two.\nyusheng kuo: What this means is like every day at 8:00am Two minute.\nJeremy Ross: Eight hours and two minutes.\nJeremy Ross: Oh, yeah, that is confusing.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: No, no, like if you want to do every hour.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: You have to do it here.\nyusheng kuo: It would be like at every hour, a two minute pass every day.\nyusheng kuo: Every hour.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that would be easy to describe the chrome.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, this is.\nyusheng kuo: Let's do it again.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: All right, let's do it again.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Let's say.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Say something like, what do you want to schedule every week?\nJeremy Ross: Let's say Monday and Wednesday.\nyusheng kuo: Every week?\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, I want to say.\nJeremy Ross: I want to say that.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, really?\nyusheng kuo: Why?\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, dude.\nJeremy Ross: Why not?\nyusheng kuo: There you go.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Every week on Monday and at 6am.\nJeremy Ross: Is that what that means?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And like, this will be like, 6am Okay.\nyusheng kuo: 22 would be like.\nJeremy Ross: Seriously, like, this.\nyusheng kuo: It does say here.\nyusheng kuo: It does.\nyusheng kuo: Try yelling.\nyusheng kuo: Did his best, like, trying to, like, say here.\nyusheng kuo: I get it.\nyusheng kuo: Why?\nyusheng kuo: It's not easy because it's dynamic.\nyusheng kuo: Like, you can see, like.\nyusheng kuo: And.\nyusheng kuo: And then this, like, ad thing will actually, like, it could.\nyusheng kuo: It could be like, every hour, right?\nyusheng kuo: It could be like.\nyusheng kuo: And then you have to actually.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, you just click the this.\nJeremy Ross: But then if you can you make it, like, go every two hours?\nyusheng kuo: No, I don't think so.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, every two hours.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, that's where maybe.\nyusheng kuo: Maybe you could.\nyusheng kuo: It would be clear.\nyusheng kuo: Clear.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, there's a bug, so.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, wait, wait.\nyusheng kuo: No, every.\nJeremy Ross: Every hour.\nyusheng kuo: Hour.\nyusheng kuo: Every day at.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, that's a good point.\nyusheng kuo: Like, every two hours.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, maybe I'm not good at that.\nyusheng kuo: Only.\nJeremy Ross: I think it's fine.\nJeremy Ross: Let's.\nJeremy Ross: Let's leave it for now.\nyusheng kuo: Every hour?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, every two hours.\nJeremy Ross: And then so let's just.\nJeremy Ross: Let's leave it at that.\nJeremy Ross: That's fine.\nJeremy Ross: And then, so start date optional.\nJeremy Ross: Okay, that's cool.\nJeremy Ross: And an end date.\nJeremy Ross: That's great.\nJeremy Ross: Can you set multiple days that it'll run?\nyusheng kuo: What do you mean?\nJeremy Ross: Like, can you deploy, like, here, follow me on this.\nJeremy Ross: So let's say you have one agent and you want to deploy it at different schedules.\nJeremy Ross: Like, let's say.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, yeah, we can do that Wednesday.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Can you do that within one agent?\nJeremy Ross: Or it has to be two different agents.\nJeremy Ross: One would be.\nyusheng kuo: So it will be one agent, but two schedule.\nyusheng kuo: So you can set multiple schedule.\nJeremy Ross: So show me what that looks like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so for example, like.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, let's just say this, right?\nyusheng kuo: Every day at 1am.\nyusheng kuo: Wait, what?\nyusheng kuo: Oh, wait, you could actually.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, you could do like, multiple.\nyusheng kuo: Well, that's very uneasy to follow.\nyusheng kuo: But, yeah, you could do multiple.\nyusheng kuo: Like, here.\nyusheng kuo: But like.\nyusheng kuo: But that's one schedule.\nyusheng kuo: It's just like, at the.\nyusheng kuo: Any random.\nyusheng kuo: So you could do two hour.\nyusheng kuo: You can do 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, and 22 for every two hours.\nJeremy Ross: That would be an annoying message.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But let's say.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, every day.\nyusheng kuo: Let's say just normal, like, every morning, Right?\nyusheng kuo: Every day, Right.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I create this one.\nyusheng kuo: And I can schedule if you have payload, if you want to use it as a schedule, but also as a payload.\nyusheng kuo: Also take webhook.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Because every agent also have their webhook, so they can be triggered anytime.\nyusheng kuo: You can set up some kind of default, but it's optional, so you can just.\nyusheng kuo: Next.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: And then you can review it and then create that.\nyusheng kuo: So you can see you have like one schedule here, but you can add schedule.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Test two.\nyusheng kuo: So both of the schedule will run.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, this is cool.\nJeremy Ross: I like it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yurin did a really good job here.\nyusheng kuo: Because I was like, wait, why do I need multiple schedule?\nyusheng kuo: And he's like, yeah, because sometimes you want multiple schedules.\nyusheng kuo: I was like, oh, yeah, you're right.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: In the beginning, I even questioned why.\nyusheng kuo: Why would he.\nyusheng kuo: One time he said, oh, there's a time that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, he's.\nyusheng kuo: He's very thoughtful.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, yeah.\nJeremy Ross: No, this is great.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, I. I was.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: I. I totally get why it's hard to like, that's why Crown needs to be described in this way.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Because like, like, it's so there's so many different possibilities here and it's hard to bring.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I think he did his best.\nyusheng kuo: Like, you can technically do 2, 4, 6, 8.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: So, okay.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, this is good.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then you can do notification here.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Okay, walk me through the notifications.\nyusheng kuo: So enable notification means it will notify you in the email that it will be here.\nyusheng kuo: You'll always be notified.\nyusheng kuo: Or you just say you don't want to be notified and then you can notify on success.\nyusheng kuo: Like every time you success, you can only say, okay, only in the failure you point, you pin me to let me know, like there's a failure.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then you can allow reply to resume.\nyusheng kuo: We should add more work here.\nyusheng kuo: It's like if you don't enable this, the, the agent won't respond.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So now if you, if you open this, my agent would just like, this would be the real work case.\nyusheng kuo: Like this morning I. I talked to my agent.\nyusheng kuo: So this is what actually they will get.\nyusheng kuo: This one say, oh, it's completed.\nyusheng kuo: So that's the first email I got from the datagen agent.\nyusheng kuo: You say, I completed.\nyusheng kuo: I create a branch.\nyusheng kuo: Here's a pull request.\nyusheng kuo: Here's the result.\nyusheng kuo: You have 80 total user.\nyusheng kuo: The power user is you.\nyusheng kuo: And something about this, this is like a result.\nyusheng kuo: But because also in the meantime, I create a specific like Gmail to create this report.\nyusheng kuo: So this is through my agent to create this report.\nyusheng kuo: So this is not my email notification.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: So that is something that you're you're using that one tool where you can like send emails with.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: Native.\nyusheng kuo: What do you mean?\nJeremy Ross: Like can we make that just a one of the ways that you can output from the agent?\nyusheng kuo: You mean like the user can set up their email format?\nJeremy Ross: So.\nJeremy Ross: Well, what I'm saying is that I really like this and this is what I was hoping to send something like this.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, you can.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, I see.\nyusheng kuo: But, but the problem is like everyone might have different desired format.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So the so far the notification is just the notification of that task.\nyusheng kuo: And then if I need to ask question like, okay, what does this guy do?\nyusheng kuo: Try to complete with his latest run?\nyusheng kuo: Because I see he's trying to, trying to, trying to do something by 2:30, which is today.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And but here because of the report doesn't have like a detail of what he actually did.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: He said actually he did something at 2:3.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So I can actually ask my agent, say hey, I want to know what he did.\nyusheng kuo: That's where I actually get like a review.\nyusheng kuo: So he said, oh, like I have the result.\nyusheng kuo: What he tried to accomplish, his lattice runs here and he tried to run this.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know if it is a good thing, but I think for now our privacy actually allow us to read this.\nyusheng kuo: So he tried to fetch all the email account aggregate one up and save analytics to swabase and like data collection, data processing, his data storage.\nyusheng kuo: So his execution result, technical stack, this is like an agent created on the fly.\nyusheng kuo: So not every time we create this fly thing but like I can say, okay, I can feel the detail of this result.\nJeremy Ross: Nosy agent.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: That's why I go, no, no, no, it's not nosy.\nyusheng kuo: It's like helping us to.\nJeremy Ross: No, I know.\nJeremy Ross: To improve, I think that at some point you need to address security.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But privacy, I would say it's privacy.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, privacy.\nJeremy Ross: There we go.\nJeremy Ross: Yes, privacy.\nJeremy Ross: Okay, now it will.\nJeremy Ross: So it's sending the message like this.\nJeremy Ross: But is this enforced by something that like the way you have it set up there, like is that enforced by the way you have this, the agent programs or is that something that just naturally happens in the way that that data is sent via email?\nJeremy Ross: You know what I'm saying?\nJeremy Ross: Is your tool set up to show markdown in that way, for example?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nJeremy Ross: You don't have to do anything.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it just renders simple markdown.\nyusheng kuo: So it's not like a fancy react.\nyusheng kuo: It's just a simple markdown.\nyusheng kuo: So it's the same format.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, okay.\nyusheng kuo: So like you see like there's a branch there, pull request and here's a result of the agent.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: So one request that I have for you is to make it so that, where it says branch and pull request, make it optional to show that in the results.\nJeremy Ross: Because if I'm setting this up for reps, you don't want to give them a bunch of links that are just confusing and like noise and whatever.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, so maybe just like here, so it's like a view detail, but it's actually going to their agenda.\nyusheng kuo: Like, like just giving that like here.\nJeremy Ross: I mean.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, well what I'm saying is like that, that's good right there, that's fine.\nJeremy Ross: But like I would want the option of how that sort of formatted and that's because I want to give a bunch of reps these emails.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: But the OPS people, they want those, they want that information.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: They want to change things.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Review things.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: So they could, the OPS person could just go and occasionally check to see, okay, are there any pull requests?\nJeremy Ross: Let me push those through.\nJeremy Ross: Or they could set the bot.\nJeremy Ross: This is the other request that I had.\nJeremy Ross: Hopefully Fireflies picks it up.\nJeremy Ross: But it's the auto.\nJeremy Ross: Auto merge.\nJeremy Ross: Right, the auto commit.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: You don't even have to deal with pull request requests because like I said.\nyusheng kuo: That should be something that user is like a dangerous skip.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Dangerous skip thing.\nJeremy Ross: As well.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I think one way to do it I could think of, I was thinking that is like instead of like a create pull request, it's like a drop down option because never write anything.\nyusheng kuo: Like if it's like for certain user you just never write anything.\nyusheng kuo: So the agent would never be able to write anything.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then also like the like a pull request, the normal one or like always auto merge to me.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Yep.\nJeremy Ross: So I guess there's three options.\nJeremy Ross: It's never right.\nJeremy Ross: Pull request only and then auto merge like after merge.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But auto merge sometimes might fail.\nJeremy Ross: Well in that case there's an error notification and yeah, there's.\nyusheng kuo: There would be there GitHub would give that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, our agent will also give that.\nyusheng kuo: Hey, we have a failure because that's considered fail.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: Well anyways, the merge doesn't matter too much, at least initially because the rep would be engaging with an agent that has that ongoing memory.\nJeremy Ross: And so it's not like it has to be in the GitHub for it to engage with it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: The way it's a cloned version, isn't it?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: So it's a cloned version that's not even touching everything else.\nyusheng kuo: But no, no.\nyusheng kuo: So, so actually what actually update the data, at least from our current setup is our agent, like a schedule agent will go into like update that instead of like a, like a wrap.\nyusheng kuo: It would be powerful.\nyusheng kuo: I can say, hey, wrap.\nyusheng kuo: And say, hey, I'd like save this to.\nyusheng kuo: To our repo.\nyusheng kuo: Right, okay.\nyusheng kuo: Later on.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, okay.\nyusheng kuo: Because they can say okay.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, okay.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: And then so just go back to what we were talking about earlier with the schedule and run now.\nJeremy Ross: So after you go through that schedule flow, then it appears at the bottom and that's basically.\nJeremy Ross: That means that it's scheduled and it will run now.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nJeremy Ross: The thing that I think is super important to limit or to make like the confusion a lot less is if you go up to the top where it says run now.\nJeremy Ross: I think that really has to change to test run.\nJeremy Ross: And the reason why is because right now it seems like that causes the schedule to turn on and like that does something official instead of just running at one time.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, okay, I see.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, yeah.\nJeremy Ross: So it really has to be test run.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: Then that would force people to look more into the other things like schedule and everything else.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, Jeremy, I. I need to join Yueling for.\nyusheng kuo: For merge.\nyusheng kuo: Is.\nyusheng kuo: Will you be up until like in another 30 minutes?\nyusheng kuo: What do you have in the morning?\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, yeah, no, I have to work on stuff.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Then I will call you or if not, then we meet tomorrow morning.\nyusheng kuo: So let's try to.\nyusheng kuo: Because we haven't been able to like go into the agent setup we had.\nyusheng kuo: I think that's super important.\nyusheng kuo: But we are at least kind of clear how to set up the agent thing.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, you, you hopefully you can.\nyusheng kuo: You can start to test it now.\nJeremy Ross: Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna test it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then, and then if you, if you see any failure, let me know.\nyusheng kuo: Make sure you include the right secret.\nyusheng kuo: If the agent actually would require that we don't have a way to auto detect that at the moment.\nyusheng kuo: We will try to like, basically we can.\nyusheng kuo: Like, because it's hard to know if you're for example, like I like to create script and then let agent to use the script.\nyusheng kuo: And then if that script requires some variable, I need like a secret like API key.\nyusheng kuo: I need to put it here.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so yeah, you just need to make sure that if you see like if you are using like a house bar, for example, you need to include your house bar API key here.\nJeremy Ross: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, go ahead.\nyusheng kuo: And I will pin you if it's not too late.\nyusheng kuo: Hopefully.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nJeremy Ross: All right.\nyusheng kuo: See you around.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, bye.\nTitle: Kodex ai agent\nHost Email: No host email\nOrganizer Email: yusheng.kuo@datagen.dev\nCalendar Id: No calendar id\nFireflies Users: yusheng.kuo@datagen.dev\nParticipants: yusheng.kuo@datagen.dev\nDate: 1770267000000\nTranscript Url: https://app.fireflies.ai/view/01KGP262XDN5XP2S7NXEWSMBA8\nAudio Url: https://cdn.fireflies.ai/01KGP262XDN5XP2S7NXEWSMBA8/audio.mp3?Expires=1770487449&Policy=eyJTdGF0ZW1lbnQiOlt7IlJlc291cmNlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9jZG4uZmlyZWZsaWVzLmFpLzAxS0dQMjYyWERONVhQMlM3TlhFV1NNQkE4L2F1ZGlvLm1wMyIsIkNvbmRpdGlvbiI6eyJEYXRlTGVzc1RoYW4iOnsiQVdTOkVwb2NoVGltZSI6MTc3MDQ4NzQ0OX19fV19&Signature=R5GaW-MGMc30lU7J3kEfySR4kKtT9l7KaGmUEgOHhXkj9UkRsD~aJpZcSryJUyGMTJN8~QbRcRSO-tJ1wUs1WZgvcSxY0cFkTAkeNpwXubDZk0d1sIx4WB4S~xFsOhXBtS-TbiiYNDfL7g5eNeSAfqX1JMa9ZbWd5lwjc-vZGZZlFhG-y-DBud4r5izyPl802bAc062a3y9bSNPlf93ShCbrNyyzJcNzJxcjkgx7uoCTAKUGK2kvlqLvTL6j8aCEz9sF1~yI1QyawQFSsGCMxURSFLjCrU0lsYFTFQQHj~ft0Hd1PaGKAPSJOFTECVqysTWqOsGDtFpUM5EKXOO3Uw__&Key-Pair-Id=K25ZJR0UZVF4CM\nVideo Url: No video url\nDuration: 73.27999877929688\nMeeting Attendees: No meeting attendees\nCal Id: No cal id\nCalendar Type: No calendar type\nMeeting Link: https://meet.google.com/vwd-qzre-mjm"
