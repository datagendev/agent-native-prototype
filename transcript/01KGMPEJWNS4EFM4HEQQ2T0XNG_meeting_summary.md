- **Role:** Agency owner providing B2B lead generation and outreach services
- **Industry:** B2B marketing/sales automation agency serving German market

### Pain Points

#### Pain Point 1: Claude Code Doesn't Scale for Production Workflows
**Description:** Cloud Code fails to reliably process large datasets (150+ records), making it unsuitable for production-scale lead enrichment despite being excellent for strategy and prototyping.
**Evidence from transcript:**
> "I tried to analyze like close one deals in HubSpot for a company and it only did it. I told it like it's 150 companies and I told it do it for every company and it's only, it only did it for me like for 50 companies. And I tried to do more. Do more but it didn't really do it. So I feel like it's. It's not good... Yeah, like it's not good for. It's not able to do it for like 20000 companies."

#### Pain Point 2: Time-Consuming Clay Table Build-Out
**Description:** Building enrichment workflows in Clay requires manual, time-intensive configuration of each column and integration, despite already having the logic figured out in Claude Code.
**Evidence from transcript:**
> "And honestly the most time consuming task is to build it in clay... all the processes that are before creating, before going into Clay, I have already figured out via cloud calls like yeah, yeah. How the process is looking like what, what APIs to use and so on."

#### Pain Point 3: Difficulty Integrating Claude Code Workflows into Clay
**Description:** After developing enrichment strategies in Claude Code, there's no easy way to deploy those workflows into Clay for production-scale execution, forcing manual recreation of logic.
**Evidence from transcript:**
> "I probably need to figure out how each UI component in Clay to redo it again... whatever you develop in Karl code, you can immediately actually use that in your clay. That, that's like the high level idea. Yeah, yeah, no, that makes sense. Yeah, I think that would be helpful because that's the thing that I'm struggling with."

#### Pain Point 4: Clay Sculptor Limitations for Automation
**Description:** Clay's AI assistant (Sculptor) is unreliable for building enrichment columns, randomly selecting inappropriate APIs instead of following proper logic.
**Evidence from transcript:**
> "I tried Sculptor, but it's not really good to be honest in building things... But creating columns, it just takes some random APIs and then it doesn't really make sense."

#### Pain Point 5: Scalability Bottleneck for Agency Growth
**Description:** Manual workflow setup prevents the agency from scaling to serve 100+ clients simultaneously, limiting business growth potential.
**Evidence from transcript:**
> "Like your client can like get. You can't have like 100 clients at the same time without being super overwhelmed. If you can set up the automation tool. Possible."

#### Pain Point 6: Speed of Implementation Impacts Client Success
**Description:** Campaign setup time delays client testing cycles, but faster implementation would enable more experimentation and better results.
**Evidence from transcript:**
> "I think the most important thing that you can provide them is one, that's your context repository. But second is like how fast you can implement, because the faster you can implement them, the more tests they can do. Like, okay, you tell me one thing. I will have a campaign tomorrow ready for you then. Yeah, I know most of the agency couldn't provide that, like even just a baseline."

### Summary
David's primary challenge is the gap between Claude Code's excellent strategy/prototyping capabilities and Clay's production-scale execution. He needs a way to deploy Claude Code workflows as API endpoints that Clay can call at scale, eliminating manual rebuild work and enabling his agency to serve more clients faster.
