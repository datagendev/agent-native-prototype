mean.\nyusheng kuo: So I think it's kind of murky.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it, I don't know if it's just me, but it seems a bit murky.\nAlberto Campora: Can you hear me?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, that's better.\nyusheng kuo: Cool.\nyusheng kuo: Better.\nAlberto Campora: First.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, I was saying like to you Ellen.\nAlberto Campora: Nice to meet you.\nAlberto Campora: Nice to meet you.\nAlberto Campora: Well, first I mean the reason.\nAlberto Campora: Let's set the context.\nAlberto Campora: I don't know what context you provided.\nAlberto Campora: You should that in terms of like how we end up here is basically from your conversation.\nAlberto Campora: We will start to explore some potential use cases based on you know, some charts that we had and you know, for me more observing in terms of like what the the market is is offering.\nAlberto Campora: I thought that you know, we, we discussed a few use cases and I thought it would be interesting to buy something very, very specific.\nAlberto Campora: I mean this is from a few iterations we had and I thought based on what I've been observing that there is a, there is a segment in the market of companies that have kind of are relying still rely on you know, face to face activities and where sales agent sales individuals don't really have much time first to ensure data quality in the CRM but at the same time they also rely a lot from the CRM in order to do the, you know, their work.\nAlberto Campora: And if we think about you know, the rise of GTM engineers, all these things I think out there there is a majority of companies will never have even A lot of companies that have probably even more than five, six, even 10 sales agents will probably will never.\nyusheng kuo: Have.\nAlberto Campora: GTM engineer but they will still have a group of people that rely on the CRM their data and it's a group of people that will need to benefit from you know, have a faster understanding of context, faster understanding of faster processing of data.\nAlberto Campora: And I think by discussing like why a lot of people are focusing on GTM engineering and obviously people that are advanced in terms of how to use AI.\nAlberto Campora: I think there's a large portion of companies that are still rely a lot on the data but they probably would never have.\nAlberto Campora: They will still they will need to rely on individuals on basically making most of their data without having someone orchestrating everything.\nAlberto Campora: So you know, to the question, To the question what can be some interesting use case to solve and how we you know, can be something competitive within the market and kind of different.\nAlberto Campora: That's basically that has been my, my insight of kind of moving away from where everybody focus and moving on a certain segment where maybe for a reason but I don't know a lot of cash with Tool don't really focus on.\nAlberto Campora: And that's, that's why we are here.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So I think from at least what.\nyusheng kuo: I provided to you and I think overall we want to at least for the first one it would be like.\nyusheng kuo: A voice interface, CRM input.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: In short.\nyusheng kuo: And is that correct?\nyusheng kuo: Like yeah, that would be the first one.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nAlberto Campora: I mean, yeah.\nAlberto Campora: Think about this term.\nAlberto Campora: Like I think in my, my assumption are, you know, think about these two segments of word where basically in a world where AI will be more and more dominant on everything we do, I think there will, there will be more.\nAlberto Campora: You know, on the other hand there will be more and more.\nAlberto Campora: Some there are.\nAlberto Campora: There was still a lot of industries, a lot of products where they will rely still probably invest more.\nAlberto Campora: Including the fact that probably AI will help them to save money.\nAlberto Campora: I think they will invest more on people leveraging human interaction.\nAlberto Campora: So if you think about it, you know, in the world where like even field agent people going to conferences and have a stand and promoting their product, if before and still now maybe is a big investment for some companies, more we go in the future AI will make them save money, but those money will be spent on human interaction.\nAlberto Campora: That's my assumption.\nAlberto Campora: So more and more companies will invest in field agent that will have more time for the people and less time to actually do the admin.\nAlberto Campora: By the other hand, we still need to capture the context from the human interaction.\nAlberto Campora: So even today like, you know, even today like a few, you know, there are a lot of companies where basically people are going think about hospitality, think about you know, the beauty industry, think about the, even like the retailing industry.\nAlberto Campora: Like so clothes and stuff like that.\nAlberto Campora: Like people are meeting like with the buyers, the people like showing the product.\nAlberto Campora: People go, you know, think about hospitality especially maybe in some countries over others, you know, think about like selling wines.\nAlberto Campora: Like you're not going to sell wines to a bar through AI you need to have someone going there, show you the wine, tell you the story, tell you why you should have this wine or another and then you know, convince, you know, do you still need to an agent understanding a new restaurant is opening.\nAlberto Campora: You need to go to a new restaurant.\nAlberto Campora: Like this type of activity.\nAlberto Campora: I, I don't think will will disappear.\nAlberto Campora: If only they probably will will that there will be more chances to actually smaller team to be more productive through AI but you still need to go to a place.\nAlberto Campora: You still have to visit maybe 10 restaurants in six hours including the travel.\nAlberto Campora: So you don't really have the time to actually capture the data Capture everything.\nAlberto Campora: And then these teams are still relying on very messy data.\nAlberto Campora: And probably they are in a position where, you know, they spend too much time on, on, on that over, you know, actually enjoy the work and even like, you know, doing conferences, like if you go in a conference, you still, you know, you're like maybe five people in the boots.\nAlberto Campora: You end up, you know, meeting 200 people in three hours.\nAlberto Campora: So it's very hard to capture all these contexts.\nAlberto Campora: So I think there is, I believe, and that's my assumption, a way like, okay, how out of a voice note, how can that trigger data input and data output?\nAlberto Campora: So input the data and output through a contextual analysis and output the database on.\nAlberto Campora: Okay, this is what you've done through you, but this is what your CRM tells you based on what you've done.\nAlberto Campora: And that in a, in a sort of like kind of in an action that doesn't require a lot of admin from, from the sales agent, that will definitely help their life, I think.\nyusheng kuo: Do you know if any competitors like doing this already?\nAlberto Campora: I mean speaking with a company that was.\nAlberto Campora: Speaking with the companies that is also organizing events, they told me that there are a few tools kind of very.\nAlberto Campora: The target, kind of a event led sales team.\nAlberto Campora: When I say event like you know, conference, conference maybe that basically helping them through voice note to maybe input the data.\nAlberto Campora: But none of them is actually helping them to enrich the data or to extract context out of the data they input, which I think dies.\nAlberto Campora: That is the dies that you know, the sort of the agentic layer.\nAlberto Campora: They also will have their work.\nyusheng kuo: But I don't understand so, so, so they, they, they, they, they are responsible for like turning those contacts into your CRM or it just kind of recording things.\nAlberto Campora: No, they record things and they, maybe they have, they think they, I don't know how, you know, we can do more research.\nAlberto Campora: But they input, maybe they help you to input to, to add, you know, to add your data in the CRM.\nAlberto Campora: But they don't help you to, but they don't help you to.\nAlberto Campora: Let's say I'm putting Alberto Campera.\nAlberto Campora: But they don't enrich my data.\nAlberto Campora: For example, they don't tell me where I'm from or what my company is doing.\nyusheng kuo: But they might, they might have another, they might have another CRM tool that's already doing things like that, right?\nyusheng kuo: Like clay.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, they might, but they might not, you know, of course, but you know.\nyusheng kuo: Because once the data is in CRM.\nyusheng kuo: They are like, I don't know, maybe.\nyusheng kuo: A Southern Tool like doing different things, like all working.\nyusheng kuo: I mean if, if the data is.\nyusheng kuo: Already in CRM, I think that's the.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, I mean that's, that's depend of like what CRM they use and how they use it.\nyusheng kuo: Of course.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, I guess.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So I think the key is like.\nyusheng kuo: How do we capture things into crn?\nyusheng kuo: And then I'm not quite sure like from crn, if there's still quite enough of a space to operate because there are so many.\nyusheng kuo: Like most of the CRM tool already.\nyusheng kuo: Have some kind of enrichment building.\nyusheng kuo: Like adio.\nyusheng kuo: Have the enrichment building haspa have some level of it.\nyusheng kuo: And then there are a bunch of.\nyusheng kuo: External tools trying to do that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I think we can, what we can try is probably just try to capture that from Voice into crn.\nyusheng kuo: But that one seems very achievable.\nyusheng kuo: But maybe.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's like it probably is not super hard to do.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah.\nAlberto Campora: For me like, for me there are two things because I can tell you like an exact use case of a few companies that help to go to conferences in the past.\nAlberto Campora: So yeah, one thing is to obviously you can capture the data you put in CRM.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAlberto Campora: But the other thing is like why are you doing that be able to have.\nAlberto Campora: Because think about like you have three days, okay.\nAlberto Campora: Especially in the US like conferences are very long.\nAlberto Campora: Okay.\nAlberto Campora: Like there are big conferences very long.\nAlberto Campora: Or you have.\nAlberto Campora: Even if the conference is one day, you maybe travel over the three days.\nAlberto Campora: Okay.\nAlberto Campora: There's one thing you want to do is to make sure that you are be able to respond immediately to what happened during the conference.\nAlberto Campora: Okay.\nAlberto Campora: And I think even if you capture the data in the CRM, you still, you know, assuming that you are a large company still need to have.\nAlberto Campora: Well again this is dependent.\nAlberto Campora: Maybe you can build that on the CRM, but.\nAlberto Campora: But maybe not.\nAlberto Campora: So that is like how.\nAlberto Campora: How you, you know, how you.\nAlberto Campora: You gather context out of your input.\nAlberto Campora: So for me it's like the use case.\nAlberto Campora: Okay.\nAlberto Campora: You.\nyusheng kuo: You.\nAlberto Campora: You be.\nAlberto Campora: You're able to capture all the context into the CRM somehow.\nAlberto Campora: I think how that work, you know, to.\nAlberto Campora: To be discussed.\nAlberto Campora: But then also, also the.\nAlberto Campora: The platform is helping you.\nAlberto Campora: Okay, you give me this context.\nAlberto Campora: For example, what are similar companies we were before what.\nAlberto Campora: What.\nAlberto Campora: What happened in that.\nAlberto Campora: And I know that these things are.\nAlberto Campora: Can be built within the CRM but like most of companies they don't.\nAlberto Campora: So if for me this is like kind of it's.\nAlberto Campora: And also if they, even if they don't or they could we're talking about Team they are sales like field.\nAlberto Campora: Field teams are kind of.\nAlberto Campora: I don't know, I don't know how to say properly in English but kind of like lose at some time abandoned on their work.\nAlberto Campora: It's almost like these guys, they have and girls they have a goal, they need to get leads, they need to close stuff and they can't really fast and require to the central team, oh, let's build this, let's build that.\nAlberto Campora: Because maybe there are different teams across countries managed in different ways.\nAlberto Campora: So it's almost how can you have like an end to end process that will help build teams to do a better job Then will this be integrated within.\nAlberto Campora: Fully within a CRM?\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, yeah, it's possible.\nAlberto Campora: But like how many companies will be the companies that will for me like think about data, you know, clay.\nAlberto Campora: Okay.\nAlberto Campora: Like yes, you, you can, you can embed everything you're doing clay within your CRM.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nAlberto Campora: But you, but, but a lot of companies don't.\nAlberto Campora: So it's obviously like there are, there are ways that you can also do on the CRM.\nAlberto Campora: But for me the use case like is this is something for specific for field teams of company and companies.\nAlberto Campora: They are relying on fields for the revenues and they haven't built a CRM for them, you know, because, because otherwise like you can go into two solutions.\nAlberto Campora: One is like you, you end.\nAlberto Campora: That's something the first conversation we had, right.\nAlberto Campora: Like you enter the company as a consultant and you help them to rethink about all their CRM and their, you know, their processes to.\nAlberto Campora: Or what they want to achieve and maybe that would be part of it or you target one area of the work.\nAlberto Campora: You give them like a one stop solution to improve what they do.\nAlberto Campora: But again this is, this is all.\nAlberto Campora: These are all my thinking and I'm not.\nAlberto Campora: And it's not necessarily right.\nAlberto Campora: I'm telling you what you know.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nAlberto Campora: Understand why these are my assumptions.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I think I agree.\nyusheng kuo: So in terms of like the minimal like valuable thing for them at the moment, it's just a simple voice ui.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: They can just talk to the model and then get back to.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, this is what the insight.\nyusheng kuo: What you.\nyusheng kuo: What the.\nyusheng kuo: What the what the what the company or the.\nyusheng kuo: What the contest name is and maybe auto enrich a little bit and save to the cio.\nyusheng kuo: That would be the minimal valuable.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, that would be definitely something that I think for me something like that is something that eventually some companies will try, you know.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAlberto Campora: You know I'm surprised, I was surprised, I was surprised.\nyusheng kuo: We know we did a bit of a research.\nyusheng kuo: I think there are, there are few are trying to do that, to capture the voice to do that.\nyusheng kuo: Even like a whisper flow.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: I think they might actually eventually tap into this area too because that basically just integrate into your CRM and then.\nyusheng kuo: Just like.\nyusheng kuo: They actually read your email to know the entity, the name.\nyusheng kuo: So they have better entity recognition of their dictation.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So I, I think, yeah, this is something.\nyusheng kuo: One thing I don't know is just like, I don't know what's their workflow?\nyusheng kuo: Like when do they actually write it down?\nyusheng kuo: Do they actually try to like use voice?\nyusheng kuo: No.\nyusheng kuo: Or they would just like memorize everything in their head and then when they go home, they open their laptop.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: It's like.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah.\nAlberto Campora: So from my understanding there are two ways.\nAlberto Campora: Like there's several ways.\nyusheng kuo: Think about.\nAlberto Campora: So some people just write it down on, on paper.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAlberto Campora: Other people, they might have like tablets where they are connected with hotspot and they take notes.\nyusheng kuo: Mm.\nAlberto Campora: Okay.\nAlberto Campora: Other people, they, they, they, they, they write down maybe on the phone.\nAlberto Campora: This is what really depending on like.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, think about also.\nAlberto Campora: Think about also like your field agent.\nAlberto Campora: You need to meet like 15 clients.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nAlberto Campora: And then between, you have to drive.\nAlberto Campora: Like, you can't really fuss around with a bloody tablet.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAlberto Campora: You know, like also, maybe also this kind of behavior change in terms of maybe countries and markets.\nAlberto Campora: But I can tell you like for example, and type of use case, like definitely when you are at a conference.\nAlberto Campora: I've been a sales agent at a conference and I mean that's like years ago.\nAlberto Campora: So you know, they were, they were not even the tablets.\nAlberto Campora: But yeah.\nAlberto Campora: So you know, you don't have time.\nAlberto Campora: You know, like.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, it's like even sometimes when you, you know, when you think about, you know, when you go in conference and you see like these people, maybe they don't look busy.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, they don't.\nAlberto Campora: But also the other hand that you can't really sit down like for an hour during the conference to take notes because maybe someone will come.\nAlberto Campora: So you can't really, you know, you, you invest your time or standing there, right.\nAlberto Campora: Like you don't have.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, you don't, you can't invest time on something else.\nAlberto Campora: And also a conference charge you per person.\nAlberto Campora: I mean depend of the conference.\nAlberto Campora: But like sometimes they tell you, oh, this is like \u00a310,000 for like you need to bring, you can bring only five people or you know, otherwise like \u00a315,000.\nAlberto Campora: So there is also like an ROI business model of how many people you bring There.\nAlberto Campora: So if you bring someone only taking notes.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAlberto Campora: And also how can you take notes when like sometimes you have five people having five different conversations, you know, so it's, you know, I think it is for me as much as, like, I don't know.\nAlberto Campora: I'm comparing this to the use case of deep research for perspective.\nAlberto Campora: Like today we have so many tools that they are building their reputation and their, and their business model on that use case.\nAlberto Campora: Right.\nAlberto Campora: There are a lot of tools that only basically they, at the end of the day, they mostly do that.\nyusheng kuo: You mean team research?\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, they help you to research your problem.\nAlberto Campora: And it's true, it's true, it's true.\nAlberto Campora: They provide you value.\nAlberto Campora: But yeah, a sales agent can still do a lot of good research.\nAlberto Campora: Without that, you're just taking more time.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nAlberto Campora: So for me it's the same like that, you know, conferences and people, conference will, will still do stuff.\nAlberto Campora: They will still, they've been doing for 10 years.\nAlberto Campora: They were still doing it.\nAlberto Campora: But yeah, it's been always a pain.\nAlberto Campora: Like if you speak to people at conference, like people are exhausted about that.\nAlberto Campora: There is always that, that, that friction.\nAlberto Campora: Like we capture the right data and we.\nAlberto Campora: What about the email?\nAlberto Campora: What about that email?\nAlberto Campora: Like, oh, what about that?\nAlberto Campora: What about the conversation people, you know, debriefs and like country briefs.\nAlberto Campora: And then there you have these five people maybe out there for five days and you have the rest of the team and the headquarter and they ask you how is it going?\nAlberto Campora: And then you have to prove that they rely on your investment in the conference.\nAlberto Campora: How you prove it?\nAlberto Campora: You know, like it's number, lead, number of conversation.\nAlberto Campora: But then we know that you know that someone is, is gonna buy you after the conference, you know, it's gonna take time.\nAlberto Campora: So how do you create attribution of that?\nAlberto Campora: And for me, all of this is based on like the better understanding of the context of all your conversations.\nAlberto Campora: So better you capture what happened better, you will be able to tell a better story.\nAlberto Campora: That's my assumption.\nAlberto Campora: It's the same as like, better you are, you know, you are better.\nAlberto Campora: More data, better data.\nAlberto Campora: You capture your perspective prospecting better.\nAlberto Campora: You can do your first part of the job.\nAlberto Campora: And it's true and that's how it works.\nAlberto Campora: But even in prospecting with AI, you still need to put some effort.\nAlberto Campora: It's not like you click it and then you know, you're done.\nAlberto Campora: You sell stuff, you know, then you still need to put creativity.\nAlberto Campora: You need to see.\nAlberto Campora: And for me, it's the same.\nAlberto Campora: I'm comparing Is the same thing.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, but it's just like two different use cases and two different type of people and these two different type of selling.\nAlberto Campora: But no, no, no.\nAlberto Campora: Is one is not necessarily less important than the other and some industry will rely and still rely a lot on think about the construction industry.\nyusheng kuo: Like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nAlberto Campora: Like you still need to go to this conference.\nAlberto Campora: You still need to do these people.\nAlberto Campora: Like people AI will not.\nAlberto Campora: If, if, if only it will probably willing people.\nAlberto Campora: It will invest more.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, because I think the question, the question I had, I think Yuri Pro had the same question is like how.\nyusheng kuo: How badly people want this type of product?\nyusheng kuo: Like have you gauge it a little bit?\nyusheng kuo: Like, like how bad.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, that's a good question.\nAlberto Campora: I don't know.\nAlberto Campora: But is that for me I'm, I'm putting like best and going back on the prospecting.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, but, but do you know, you know Phil self and then have you brought up this idea or maybe just like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, just brought up this idea.\nyusheng kuo: What do they feel about it?\nyusheng kuo: They feel.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, I brought up this idea on definitely a few teams and they were excited but we talking about small teams.\nAlberto Campora: So I don't know if it's, you.\nyusheng kuo: Know.\nAlberto Campora: I'm not, I'm.\nAlberto Campora: I mean I'm taking that as a positive sign.\nAlberto Campora: But you know, obviously it could be.\nyusheng kuo: Color polite, you mean?\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, but for me this, I'm starting more from, from the problem.\nAlberto Campora: Like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nAlberto Campora: And I'm comparing that to also the prospecting part.\nAlberto Campora: Like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAlberto Campora: You know, the ability to capture data faster and better during your field activity is a problem.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, it's a fact.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAlberto Campora: Like it's, it.\nAlberto Campora: Then will companies still exist and still continue to exist?\nAlberto Campora: Like.\nAlberto Campora: Yes, but again, you know, prospecting, like is there a problem?\nAlberto Campora: Yes.\nAlberto Campora: Can you still carry on without it?\nAlberto Campora: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAlberto Campora: So.\nyusheng kuo: But yeah, I agree.\nyusheng kuo: It's like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I mean you don't, you don't necessarily need the voice input.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: But people enjoy.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, but that, yeah, but that's for me is because like it's, it's, it's one of those things is like as much as like prospecting is like when you start to see that actually provide you value because you start to using it, you start to use it better, you start understanding.\nAlberto Campora: Okay.\nAlberto Campora: Then you start to see the value, you know.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, because you know.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I think, I think it's like.\nyusheng kuo: It'S, it's, it's, it's, it's.\nyusheng kuo: It sounds like a very reasonable thing that people want.\nyusheng kuo: Like just I talk to someone and then right after you're talking to it.\nyusheng kuo: You can just like Talk to like ChatGPT for example.\nyusheng kuo: And then, and then everything just like being put in.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then that will come to.\nyusheng kuo: My second question is like how, what do you think?\nyusheng kuo: If we say use, we first just create a simple MCP for example that connected to their CRN and then, and then we will help them to add that, install that and then they can.\nyusheng kuo: Just use cloud to talk to them.\nyusheng kuo: And then let them feel if there's something they want.\nyusheng kuo: Do you think that will be enough to test the idea or it has.\nyusheng kuo: To be a full fledged like app?\nAlberto Campora: Because I don't know for me, I think for me an interesting part is that also because you we need to.\nAlberto Campora: Because well, for me the clothes might be all right as long as like the interesting part for me is.\nAlberto Campora: And I'm talking from a perspective because I talk when I spoke about these ideas, I spoke with the decision maker.\nAlberto Campora: There are not the field agents.\nAlberto Campora: That's why like for me the field agents are kind of solo wolves.\nAlberto Campora: And then sometimes it's not the people we need to sell to.\nAlberto Campora: Okay.\nAlberto Campora: The people that we need to start, they're still the heads of sales, but we need to create layer because for me it's like it would be interesting to find and maybe like in a very simple way, like, because it's interesting to provide to the sales team to have a easier life, but also for the edge to also to know basically to have a.\nAlberto Campora: Because if, if we create a way to import data to have basically.\nyusheng kuo: If.\nAlberto Campora: Every conversation that happened offline becomes something online, we are also able to measure the impact of what's happening and then so the head of sales is understanding in real time.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, but that's.\nAlberto Campora: You know what I mean?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's also possible.\nyusheng kuo: I mean I don't see like if you have an MCP there, it's also.\nyusheng kuo: Very possible you can just retrieve those data in real time.\nyusheng kuo: Like the salespeople would input that through the MCP and then the head of.\nyusheng kuo: Cells can just retrieve whatever the data that's already been saved into the CRM through the MCP as well.\nAlberto Campora: For me that is also super powerful because you're basically connecting.\nAlberto Campora: You allow the team at the headquarter to understand what's going on.\nAlberto Campora: And imagine companies that like five conference happening at the same time within a week.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then we recently have, we added this power.\nyusheng kuo: You can turn MCP into code.\nyusheng kuo: So you can even ask a lovable created app that have the MCP as a component to show the data.\nyusheng kuo: You can create a dashboard out of the MCP results.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so yeah, I think.\nyusheng kuo: And it can be easily configured to whatever dashboard they will want to.\nyusheng kuo: So my question is, okay, so if we can provide SMCP as a very simple thing and now I would say the voice mode for Both Cloud and ChatGPT were quite good.\nyusheng kuo: We can try to leverage that as the first step to just know if that's something they want and we can basically just sell them this MCP first.\nyusheng kuo: And if you like the idea they want to continue, then we can.\nyusheng kuo: And then they feel the limitation of using mcp.\nyusheng kuo: Then we can try to build an app that dedicated for it.\nyusheng kuo: I just don't know if that, that's something you, you think it's viable or, or you think it's.\nyusheng kuo: There's some kind of limiting factor.\nAlberto Campora: I think we, you need to think about something.\nAlberto Campora: For me, the way to, to this to happen, like it has to be something that under the teams and to plug in and test like in the way I see it is like, you know, if we can build something where we reach out because we know where conferences are happening, we know the company that field, field agents, we know what the CRM they have and then we can say maybe we only like we focus only on companies that have spot because then you know, we can build something on the top of the ecosystem.\nAlberto Campora: But then we can say, you know, because you want to try this at your next conference.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, you know, like it's kind of.\nAlberto Campora: If it's something we were like we frictionless to test, it's probably like it's going to be.\nAlberto Campora: Wouldn't say easy, but it's going to be possible to try to get, to identify some traction and some tester within, you know, certain amount of time because we know the companies are happening.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I mean we can.\nyusheng kuo: I, I think nowadays because so many.\nyusheng kuo: People have follow like in their, in their, in their, in their, in their phone.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So I, I would say it's probably even more precisionless.\nyusheng kuo: Like we can just like show them the MCP we created and, and then they can just talk to them and then, and then we can showcase.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, I can just talk to you.\nyusheng kuo: And now after we talk to you, like I will already like have my CRM updated just using the cloud as a platform to do that instead of like asking them to download a new app.\nyusheng kuo: And then because the MCP can just be like installed through a URL so they can just, if they have cloud, if we say, okay, we narrow down to customer who Use Cloud.\nyusheng kuo: Who has cloud?\nyusheng kuo: And also use Hotspot, for example, and we can immediately help them to add their hotspot.\nyusheng kuo: So I don't know.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: If that, that's something that.\nyusheng kuo: To you.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, no, no.\nyusheng kuo: Where do you see the friction is?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAlberto Campora: I mean, for me, it's hard to say.\nAlberto Campora: We need to.\nAlberto Campora: The only way is to test it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Because if you want, I mean, do you know when's the next conference?\nyusheng kuo: We can create an MCP just for that and then let people see how they can just like use the call and then talk to them and then like get the, get the CRM updated immediately.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, for me it's like, it's, it's interesting to understand, like if we want to do this, how we.\nAlberto Campora: We gonna.\nAlberto Campora: We.\nAlberto Campora: We know, we organize this team.\nAlberto Campora: That's it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nAlberto Campora: So how I'm interested to, to, to.\nAlberto Campora: To, you know, to help, but like, you know, like, for me, like all this question, like, I don't have answers, but I'm happy to find out.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAlberto Campora: You know.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I think what we can do is we can provide a very dedicated, like hotspot CIM that's specific with all the tool that's very specific for the, for the field sales engineer and field salespeople.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So they don't even need to trigger the word.\nyusheng kuo: They just need.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And you can test it.\nyusheng kuo: You can just talk to Cloud and see if that actually give you the right answer.\nyusheng kuo: And actually the MCP ui also, you can provide the UI in accessory in Cloud, but it hasn't been released yet.\nyusheng kuo: And, but even without that, you can still see the answer of the update and.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, if we can create that for.\nyusheng kuo: You and you can test it and maybe you can tell us if it's reasonable.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know.\nyusheng kuo: What do you think about it?\nyusheng kuo: We would just create a MCP that's hosted remotely using OAUTH of.\nyusheng kuo: So you don't, you don't even need to go through all this mcp.\nyusheng kuo: Hell, it would just like turn on mcp, add the URL and add it.\nyusheng kuo: That's it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I mean, you can test it.\nyusheng kuo: And then you can immediately test it.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, yeah, I think it will be.\nAlberto Campora: For me, it will be an interesting thing to test.\nAlberto Campora: Like if we build like, you know, a landing page around it and then we, we kind of present it as something it will be in, you know, first.\nAlberto Campora: I think, you know, we can even test ourselves, right?\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, because we can.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, we can mock.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, we have cloth.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nAlberto Campora: We can mock the scenarios, you know and then you know, by mocking the scenarios we can also kind of create a demo and you know and demonstration to.\nAlberto Campora: To.\nyusheng kuo: To share.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, I mean that made up.\nAlberto Campora: I don't know.\nAlberto Campora: I have.\nAlberto Campora: I have the feeling that obviously I don't.\nAlberto Campora: I don't know.\nAlberto Campora: I don't have all the answers but is something that.\nAlberto Campora: Because it will speak to a very specific use case.\nAlberto Campora: A very specific type of company.\nAlberto Campora: Slightly different than target other tools.\nyusheng kuo: You mean they might not have Cloth for example.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, which is definitely a risk.\nAlberto Campora: But also I think we are reaching a state.\nyusheng kuo: But I think if we want to just test out like okay, this voice input will help their life, then we can first test on people who have cloud.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: That should give us the same answer.\nyusheng kuo: And then we can say okay, this is useful.\nyusheng kuo: And then we can build an app for people who doesn't have claw.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's what I feel that kind of a progress.\nAlberto Campora: I don't think we need to build anything special for me is more like the only risk.\nAlberto Campora: Well the one thing they will be interesting somehow.\nAlberto Campora: It doesn't have to be in a separate app, whatever.\nAlberto Campora: But we need.\nAlberto Campora: Because for me the only limitation of.\nAlberto Campora: Of cloth or you know the traditional UI that I kind of.\nAlberto Campora: Whatever happened get get bored, you know, get.\nAlberto Campora: Get kind of get lost in a black hole.\nAlberto Campora: Like I don't know how.\nyusheng kuo: Like.\nAlberto Campora: Because if you start to.\nAlberto Campora: Because the question is like imagine like you using this thing for a day.\nAlberto Campora: Five people using this for a day.\nAlberto Campora: How do you have something at the end of the day that tells you this is actually what have you done through this?\nAlberto Campora: And this is like the impact you had.\nAlberto Campora: Because for me I'm doing comparison with clay.\nAlberto Campora: Right.\nAlberto Campora: The difference between running a line and clay where ultimately you might get the same results of what you will get through a cloth chart is that the results still there on that table.\nAlberto Campora: You can easily say okay, I run hundreds.\nyusheng kuo: Oh yes.\nAlberto Campora: So you know what I mean?\nAlberto Campora: Like so you still.\nyusheng kuo: You can.\nyusheng kuo: You can see all the data that we put in.\nyusheng kuo: In Hotspot.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So Hotspot have like mobile app.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: But they don't.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, yeah.\nAlberto Campora: We still.\nAlberto Campora: We need to find a way that maybe even threw up spot.\nAlberto Campora: But we need to be clever on showing on.\nAlberto Campora: On be able for someone that is using it to immediately see the impact of it.\nAlberto Campora: Even if it's the data they are entering up.\nAlberto Campora: Spot have a different colors.\nAlberto Campora: You know what I mean?\nAlberto Campora: Like.\nAlberto Campora: Like whatever it is we need to.\nAlberto Campora: Because if.\nAlberto Campora: Because otherwise the risk is that we.\nAlberto Campora: They're not gonna.\nAlberto Campora: They're not gonna see the value of using it versus using cloth.\nAlberto Campora: Just cloth without, you know.\nyusheng kuo: But how do they use cloth to do it without rmcp?\nAlberto Campora: I don't know.\nAlberto Campora: Because they're gonna say, oh, well, we.\nAlberto Campora: Because the risks can be like, oh, we.\nAlberto Campora: Well, we have.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, we have ChatGPT3.\nAlberto Campora: We're using it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then, I mean, if they.\nyusheng kuo: Even if they use chargeability and then.\nyusheng kuo: Be able to do whatever we want to let them do, then.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, then they should use chargeability, I think.\nyusheng kuo: I mean, our MCP should provide the differentiation value.\nyusheng kuo: Otherwise.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I mean, I mean, I. I.\nyusheng kuo: Just don't think how value should be relied on.\nyusheng kuo: We can show the color of the.\nAlberto Campora: No, color is an example.\nAlberto Campora: Don't take me literally.\nAlberto Campora: Like, okay, I'm saying, like, we need to.\nAlberto Campora: It's like somehow if some.\nAlberto Campora: That whatever it is, even if it's through clothes is used for a day, we need to find a way to show, okay, what happened.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I mean, we could have a tool to generate.\nyusheng kuo: Just say, what have we.\nyusheng kuo: What have I done through our mcp?\nyusheng kuo: And that tool would just generate a report of what you've done with this MCP today.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that should be quite straightforward to do.\nyusheng kuo: So you can just say, hey, okay, yeah, give me a summary of today's input.\nyusheng kuo: And then it would just generate things.\nyusheng kuo: The nice thing, I think through call is you can continue to ask the question, like, say, what have I done today?\nyusheng kuo: What should I be improved?\nyusheng kuo: So on and so forth.\nyusheng kuo: It's just like, you can just continue to use cloud and then the context from things we put into our mcp.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then we can pull data.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAlberto Campora: For me, for the build teams, I will almost making this kind of additional question as standardized as possible, because I think the sales team has.\nAlberto Campora: Has no time to think about this stuff.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nAlberto Campora: You know, like, they want answers and they want to be able to say, bam, boom, boom, beam, boom, boom.\nAlberto Campora: And they know because ultimately they have one goal.\nAlberto Campora: You know, they.\nAlberto Campora: Ultimately the bottom line is how they survive.\nAlberto Campora: You know, it's not like, yeah, yeah, GTM engineer, like, oh, we did this and blah, blah, blah.\nAlberto Campora: We integrated like we did, you know.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nAlberto Campora: You know, for them, it's like it's one day they're like, they, they, they, they, they.\nAlberto Campora: You know, the rest of the world doesn't exist.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAlberto Campora: You know?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAlberto Campora: Like I'm telling you, my friend, My friends are filled.\nAlberto Campora: They work like their sales field.\nAlberto Campora: Sales in hospitality.\nAlberto Campora: Like, no, there are no prisoners.\nyusheng kuo: So what exactly they want for them?\nAlberto Campora: They just want to just have a.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I know, but like, what do they want from this tool?\nyusheng kuo: I guess.\nAlberto Campora: Well, they want to have it.\nAlberto Campora: They want to reduce as much as possible the data inputs, but they also rely on the data to do a better job.\nAlberto Campora: So it's almost like Sheeter.\nyusheng kuo: Sorry, let me refresh.\nyusheng kuo: So what's the issue of building an MCP in cloud?\nyusheng kuo: Would say, like, if they have cloud.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So what was the issue?\nyusheng kuo: If we are using MCP in cloud for them to do that, what are the extra effort they need to suffer compared to building that app?\nyusheng kuo: Compared to using an app?\nyusheng kuo: Like what.\nyusheng kuo: What's the extra effort they need to put in by not using.\nyusheng kuo: By.\nyusheng kuo: By using Claw with mcp?\nAlberto Campora: What the actual.\nAlberto Campora: Well, the.\nAlberto Campora: As I said, like, at some point they need to prove that they need to understand the impact of what.\nAlberto Campora: Of what happened by using what they've been using it, what's.\nAlberto Campora: What's been resolved.\nAlberto Campora: And also having something, having if also whatever they use has been helping them to inform the rest of the company in real time what was happening.\nAlberto Campora: It will also remove from them the need of like updates and say what's happening and why it's happening.\nAlberto Campora: Like this is like, it's kind of like removing.\nAlberto Campora: But.\nyusheng kuo: But why cloud couldn't do that.\nyusheng kuo: I think my question.\nAlberto Campora: I'm not saying couldn't, I'm saying like, oh, okay, yeah, I'm not.\nyusheng kuo: I think my question is like, why, like, can.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: The question is, can we use McP as our MVP first?\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, I'm not against.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, okay, okay, okay.\nyusheng kuo: I was trying to understand this.\nAlberto Campora: No, no, I'm not against it.\nAlberto Campora: I'm just saying, like, if also.\nAlberto Campora: I'm saying if also.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nAlberto Campora: Like, yeah, yeah, if also.\nAlberto Campora: There is a way to make sure that even in MVP we can prove we can showcase the impact of using it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nAlberto Campora: It will also help to demystify, I think the use of MCP for this kind of activity.\nAlberto Campora: I think it will help also to basically have the adoption, I think.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, because for me, I think if you tell.\nAlberto Campora: If you made them a promise, you know, but then at the end of the day they don't understand.\nAlberto Campora: You know, bear in mind that these people are still not, not everyone, but there is, there is still like a high friction of CRM adoption in the field sales world, you know, like, so we are talking to them about something that, you know, it's even more advanced.\nAlberto Campora: Right.\nAlberto Campora: These people, they still discussing about how to use upspot, how to, you Know why using a spot why is important.\nAlberto Campora: Like, you know, bear in mind this.\nAlberto Campora: So we need to make sure that if we offer them something else, they need to have a sense of why it's important to use it.\nAlberto Campora: I'll help them because otherwise they're not going to use it.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, that's, that's what I mean.\nAlberto Campora: Like if they don't see the impact.\nAlberto Campora: And that's why, that's why, that's why the CRM.\nAlberto Campora: The adoption of CRM is so hard for the field sales team.\nAlberto Campora: Because the problem of the CRM is that unless everyone is using it, not everybody will get impact.\nAlberto Campora: Right.\nAlberto Campora: So if someone doesn't use it and then the other one, it does, you know, see the other one is not use it.\nAlberto Campora: Like, oh, why, why I should spend time on this when ultimately I'm gonna be anyway, so I'm doing stuff as I want.\nAlberto Campora: So if we don't show them that is helping them and how immediately they're gonna, they're gonna be resistant.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I see.\nAlberto Campora: You know.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, we can, we can add the visualization tool to help them to like.\nAlberto Campora: Something to show them, like, okay, you, you be, you usually, you know, you've been spending, you know, this is, you know, to prove them that, you know, actually you haven't.\nAlberto Campora: Because the worst case scenario will be we made them a promise.\nAlberto Campora: I'm telling you, the worst case scenario.\nAlberto Campora: So the worst case scenario is like, we made them a promise.\nAlberto Campora: They haven't been used any pen and paper, they haven't been using any tablet, and they've been relying on what we offer them to make the most of the conference.\nAlberto Campora: Right.\nAlberto Campora: So it's a big, it's a big promise.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nAlberto Campora: And if it doesn't work, they're.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, but they're like, they're, they're as, as.\nAlberto Campora: Because they're gonna, they're gonna be as individuals, not the company.\nAlberto Campora: It's their job.\nAlberto Campora: They're gonna be fired.\nyusheng kuo: Understand?\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, you know?\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, that's what I mean.\nAlberto Campora: You know, it's like we, we talking to people.\nAlberto Campora: They are there.\nAlberto Campora: I think they're, they're on the edge and they're like, they need, like they, they need definitely.\nAlberto Campora: I think when we talk about augmented AI, for me, their role is the role that probably should benefit the most, but obviously is, is the role where if AI up, they are probably the most up because they are last people on the chain.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, you know.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I understand.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: The stake there.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I think we can start by just testing ourselves and then you can Let them test it on the go and see how comfortable it is and how convenient it is.\nyusheng kuo: And then I think we can start from here and then we can have a visualization tool.\nyusheng kuo: Say like, okay, show me what you've got.\nyusheng kuo: And then we just visualize everything.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, it's something that, you know, we don't have to over complicate, but it's something that also I think will provide a bit of confidence because then if they're using it, then we can improve it.\nAlberto Campora: Because if they're not using it, we will never.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, because the only problem with this is like, it's, it's.\nyusheng kuo: We can, we can have a, we can have a website that can log in and they can see all the input they have, like through the mcp.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: That website could just be the visualization part.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, because I'm thinking about this now.\nAlberto Campora: Like, this is like all coming up by talking loud.\nAlberto Campora: Like it's definitely compared to prospecting, this is more high risk, high reward.\nAlberto Campora: Because prospecting, you know, prospecting like through AI, like you get it wrong, you're not gonna, it's not, it's not gonna be a big deal, you lost time.\nAlberto Campora: But like if this, you rely on this to, to capture your data, you don't capture like you are.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I fully understand.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And if it could, then yeah, it's a, it could be a really huge time saver.\nyusheng kuo: You just talk to.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, but then, yeah, exactly.\nAlberto Campora: But then if you get it right and we prove every proof quality is the is.\nAlberto Campora: Is big.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, big.\nAlberto Campora: Because it's also for me is the most augmented solution because it's not going to sustain humans.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, but it's gonna just help humans to be.\nAlberto Campora: Is also, it's also mental health because if you remove all the thoughts to these people, their life is going to be way better from, from a quality of life.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, I'm telling you.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nAlberto Campora: Like all my friends are doing this.\nAlberto Campora: They spending like they come back home after seven, eight hours on the road and they.\nAlberto Campora: On a tablet and they need to put everything in.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, I get it.\nyusheng kuo: Totally.\nyusheng kuo: So I think we, we use MCP to just test if this kind of thing is useful.\nyusheng kuo: And once we can test it successfully, we can actually have a more dedicated model, whatever workflow to improve the accuracy to as high as possible.\nyusheng kuo: But I think the first thing is.\nyusheng kuo: You can test out, okay, if this thing really kind of fit into people's workflow and then get some of the early feedback, even probably not 100% accuracy.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Also we need to have data.\nyusheng kuo: We need to have data to know what, what are the way to talk and why it's failing.\nyusheng kuo: Like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so, so, yeah, so this kind of.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, but that's why we need to kind of, for me, like, we need to.\nAlberto Campora: That's why when you were telling me like we need to do, you know, customer development is true, we do need.\nAlberto Campora: But also I think the best way to do customer development, like we need to get some companies and say we're doing this, test it.\nAlberto Campora: If you, you know, if you test it for your next 32 com, next 3 conference, then you're gonna get lifetime, lifetime membership.\nAlberto Campora: I don't know.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, sure.\nAlberto Campora: You know, because we need, we.\nAlberto Campora: We need these people to tell us how far was from their life.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAlberto Campora: You know?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAlberto Campora: And then we can't, we can't tell them like, oh, you like that?\nAlberto Campora: Because they don't know how it's gonna make their life better.\nAlberto Campora: And maybe they want.\nAlberto Campora: So.\nAlberto Campora: But we need, we need to, we need to get into the field.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, you know, I agree.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I think that's like, there are so many nuance, you know, like accent, like the feel the place, different language.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So I think, yeah, it's.\nyusheng kuo: I think cloud would not be the perfect solution, but it could at least be like very first, like just giving people like, okay, if you have this tool, what would you like?\nyusheng kuo: And next we can have like for example, very dedicated, like a language tool.\nyusheng kuo: Maybe even one for each language, even.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, things like that.\nyusheng kuo: But yeah, I think, I think we.\nyusheng kuo: Can, we can start by just.\nyusheng kuo: Having.\nyusheng kuo: Something out like SCP that install for them and say, okay, now you can just talk to the cloud and then do your CRM update.\nyusheng kuo: Now you don't need to go to CRM.\nyusheng kuo: You just talk to it and let it feel if that's something the flow they want and let them tell us like, okay, this is not good because why.\nyusheng kuo: So at least we have something for people to test out, not just like some kind of bullshitting around, right?\nAlberto Campora: No, exactly.\nAlberto Campora: We need, because we need to see how far we are from.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And I think mcp for us, it was pretty easy to build down.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAlberto Campora: Okay, well, I'll let you think about and then we can use case and think about the next step.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And I can just go ahead and start to build one simple mcp.\nyusheng kuo: Just let you update your CRM and then you can try to test it.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Do you have like hotspot.\nyusheng kuo: Do you have hotspot receive?\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, I mean, I Don't use much, but, yeah, I do it for my clients.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: What do you internally use for CI I?\nyusheng kuo: For you, for your consultant?\nAlberto Campora: I use Akio.\nAlberto Campora: But my, you know, my use base is not huge.\nAlberto Campora: I mean, I'm, you know, my portfolio is, you know.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAlberto Campora: Like, you know, I'm still.\nAlberto Campora: I'm still able.\nAlberto Campora: I mean, I usually, you know, using it, but, you know, just literally not crazy.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah.\nAlberto Campora: I mean, because, you know, my company is small.\nAlberto Campora: Like, we are.\nAlberto Campora: It's me and another few people.\nAlberto Campora: Like, we don't.\nAlberto Campora: We don't even.\nAlberto Campora: We don't.\nAlberto Campora: We also don't want to speak to work with too many companies.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, it's, you know, we are happy.\nAlberto Campora: We are happy with the size.\nyusheng kuo: We are.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I understand.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, cool.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, then let us do one for.\nyusheng kuo: You and then let you test it and tell us why.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, but I think, like, we should really work, you know, also test together, like, all the option and, like, because we can, you know, we can fake a conference.\nAlberto Campora: You know, like, we can, you know, we can find a way to test it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I mean, or I can.\nyusheng kuo: I can just go to any conference that's happening here now in this abstent child.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, cool.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I have to run now.\nyusheng kuo: Have to go by here, but.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, thanks.\nyusheng kuo: Thanks.\nyusheng kuo: I think we have a good path forward.\nyusheng kuo: I will send out some kind of documentation after this.\nAlberto Campora: Yeah, thank you.\nyusheng kuo: Cool.\nyusheng kuo: Thank you.\nyusheng kuo: Bye.\nyusheng kuo: All right.\nTitle: Datagen X Alberto\nHost Email: yusheng.kuo@datagen.dev\nOrganizer Email:
