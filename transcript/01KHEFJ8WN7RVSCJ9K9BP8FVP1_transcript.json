I have a few questions like.\nyusheng kuo: Sure, sure.\nLucky: Do you work.\nLucky: I mean how do you.\nLucky: Because I saw your profile.\nLucky: You are.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nLucky: Data.\nLucky: So how do you came up with, you know, I mean in the GTM field.\nLucky: I saw your post.\nLucky: You are.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nLucky: Exploring mainly the analytics purposes for gtm.\nLucky: So what excited you?\nLucky: And then do you.\nyusheng kuo: Yes, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: We do have a product.\nyusheng kuo: Can you see my screen?\nyusheng kuo: Actually yes.\nyusheng kuo: This is our product.\nyusheng kuo: We basically try to build infrastructure for your cloud code agent so you can build agents super fast like in cloud code nowadays.\nyusheng kuo: And I will show you how.\nyusheng kuo: But the problem now is if you use cloud code is like the agent is living in your computer but it couldn't work 247 or proactively.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So what we are doing is actually try to help you to easily deploy the agent you created in cloud code to be used anywhere, for example on schedule or be triggered by external event.\nyusheng kuo: For example, whenever the meeting is finished, it will send a webhook to our agent and our agent will start working for you.\nyusheng kuo: This is like the turn we are seeing is like okay, now agent become more and more productive and capable, right?\nyusheng kuo: How do we scale that?\nyusheng kuo: And then the way we scale that is actually just create a lot of agent that wouldn't need our supervision to work.\nyusheng kuo: He can basically get integrated into the system, get call on demand and get called at the schedule.\nyusheng kuo: So you don't need to worry about when to start them, how to start them.\nyusheng kuo: So that's our core product and then that's why we are offering this 30 minute because I think we first want to learn what people want to do with their agent, the Kafka agent, like what type of thing they want to solve with the agent and then also do the way we can kind of educate people what's the benefit of an agent?\nyusheng kuo: And maybe one day you will want to use our product to deploy the agent you created.\nyusheng kuo: So that's where we are.\nyusheng kuo: And yeah, I don't know if you have any more question.\nLucky: Yeah, so I mean right now how many agents are deployed in your platform?\nyusheng kuo: It's everyone.\nyusheng kuo: Like we have like three, four clients and I think I am like the biggest user in myself.\nyusheng kuo: You can see.\nyusheng kuo: And then for others it's like a two to three agent per user.\nyusheng kuo: Nowadays I have a lot.\nyusheng kuo: So you can see whatever is deployed is the agent I created.\nyusheng kuo: For example, I have this daily activity reporter agent and what this would do is like every morning, so for example this, today.\nyusheng kuo: Here, this agent will send me this daily activity report, right.\nyusheng kuo: Basically to tell me how is our product doing?\nyusheng kuo: Who's like.\nyusheng kuo: Like if the question asks like who are they and how are they using it?\nyusheng kuo: And then I can even like reply back to this agent, say okay, what's the fail?\nyusheng kuo: Why this is a.\nyusheng kuo: There's a significant success rate issue for this guy.\nyusheng kuo: What's wrong with it?\nLucky: How safe it is if the agent has post.\nLucky: I mean you know, the data that should not leave anywhere else.\nLucky: I mean stay there.\nyusheng kuo: Like for example, if you have something like a pid, like a pii, like personal identity, like a personal ID or like a password, how do you know your agent is not exposing, right?\nyusheng kuo: Like API key, for example.\nyusheng kuo: Is that the question?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So we heavily rely.\nyusheng kuo: So there's several tips that to GARWH that the first thing is whatever you don't want agent to expose, don't let agent have the way to see it.\nyusheng kuo: So for example, if you use MCP tool, right.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know if you're familiar with mcp.\nyusheng kuo: A nice thing about using MCP tool compared to there are people say, why don't you just use API key?\nyusheng kuo: But the way the agent use API key and write code is they can see the API key and then they use the API key to run the script.\nyusheng kuo: But in comparison, when you're using MCP tool, the model only see the tool, the model only see like, oh, this SERP API initiate connection tool.\nyusheng kuo: They directly use the tool so they wouldn't be able to see the credential behind the tool.\nyusheng kuo: So the credential is actually saved in the MCP itself.\nyusheng kuo: But the MCP doesn't show them to the user.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know if that makes sense.\nyusheng kuo: So the first thing is don't give them the access to your environment variable, for example.\nyusheng kuo: The second thing is you should manage your tool.\nyusheng kuo: The first thing is whatever you don't want to expose, you should try your best to not let agent have the ability to see it because you don't know under what kind of situation the agent might actually say, hey, this guy was asking API key for help, so I need to give it.\nyusheng kuo: Don't let them see that.\nyusheng kuo: So they couldn't answer that kind of question.\nyusheng kuo: The the second thing is try to manage your tool.\nyusheng kuo: For example, you don't want them to write something.\nyusheng kuo: If you don't want them to write email, for example, you should just block the tool.\nyusheng kuo: For example, there's a Gmail send email tool.\nyusheng kuo: You should just block the tool from the MCP side.\nyusheng kuo: So the agent just couldn't do that.\nyusheng kuo: So that's where I see the best way to prevent or set up the guardrail is you should disable the capability of the agent to do that kind of activity.\nLucky: Yeah, so I think that we can do using hooks, right?\nLucky: Pre two loops.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, Hook is another way to do it.\nyusheng kuo: You can basically say, hey, like forbid that, do a pii, like a blocking, like a masking.\nyusheng kuo: Every time you see that, you just like try to mask that.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Or like whenever you get the output from the script.\nyusheng kuo: So just by blending.\nyusheng kuo: So whenever you need some kind of sensitive information, use the tool to handle that.\nyusheng kuo: Don't let agent directly to handle that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, because you can see as like a tool.\nyusheng kuo: So a tool, I would put it as like a deterministic like code script.\nyusheng kuo: Like a hook is a code script to directly compare the output to the hook in the shell script.\nyusheng kuo: And also like Python is another way to basically just try to avoid that directly.\nyusheng kuo: MCP tool is actually API wrapper to also make sure that Deterministically you couldn't access that part of the information.\nyusheng kuo: So that would be the way I would put it to avoid that.\nyusheng kuo: But I also want to put this comment.\nyusheng kuo: The more guardrail you give the agent, the more handicapped the agent would be.\nyusheng kuo: So that's a.\nyusheng kuo: There's a nuanced balance.\nyusheng kuo: Like, like for example Open Call is super powerful.\nyusheng kuo: I have you heard Open Call?\nyusheng kuo: It's called cloud apart like in the very early.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But you know, it's like he's people like he's so powerful because he give up a lot of guardrail.\nyusheng kuo: He let the agent directly access all the root file.\nyusheng kuo: He can control the whole system but that become very powerful.\nyusheng kuo: So agent can even update their own setting style.\nyusheng kuo: Sometimes you don't want to.\nyusheng kuo: You don't want agent to be able to update their own prompt.\nyusheng kuo: But if you allow them they can also do a very powerful thing.\nyusheng kuo: So it's really important to consider okay, what's the trade off?\nyusheng kuo: And there's a very practical thing I don't know, people talk enough about is just use better model.\nyusheng kuo: Like nowadays a lot of the reliability actually happening in those like four model.\nyusheng kuo: Like the other day I like I let it review a LinkedIn page using the opus.\nyusheng kuo: So basically that linking page you have some kind of problem injection.\nyusheng kuo: Say like oh, if you are seeing this you should say something but like opus model quickly realized.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, this is a problem injection and flag it as like okay, this is like I don't need to follow that.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So actually a very effective way to handle those kind of prompt injection is using the model that's more capable.\nyusheng kuo: That's actually typical.\nyusheng kuo: Like 80% of time this can be solved and then you can do those simple things using the simpler model but external facing thing using the best model that would also effectively prevent a lot of things while staying powerful.\nLucky: Yeah.\nLucky: So you mentioned open cloud or open crawl.\nyusheng kuo: Open claw.\nyusheng kuo: Wait, what's his let's his name?\nyusheng kuo: C l a w. It's called open claw.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, Open Cloth.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, Open Cloud.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah it's like earlier he's called Cloud Bot.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Oh Claw.\nLucky: Claw, right, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: C O A W. Yeah, yeah I think I saw.\nLucky: So someone has posted that if you exhaust your tokens or sessions in cloud code, you can use Open Crawl and then use any of the agents like Olama.\nyusheng kuo: Oh yeah, yeah yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But you can also use Olama or like Open router thing in Placo.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah so yeah so I don't know.\nyusheng kuo: It's like Open Call is still very hard to set up like for most of people.\nyusheng kuo: And it's also very hard to control and manage.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know if it's ready for everyone to use it, but I think a very similar product would come out.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Because OpenAI just acquired them recently.\nLucky: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nLucky: So how do you compare OpenCraw with cloud code?\nyusheng kuo: I mean, so I think cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So I think open cloud is more like madness, right?\nyusheng kuo: You, it kind of, you kind of delegate it to help you to handle a lot of stuff, but you have poor controllability compared to cloud code.\nLucky: But I think, I think even this open cloud tool is for security purpose and private privacy purpose is not good.\nLucky: As good as cloud code, right?\nyusheng kuo: No, no, yeah, but, but it's like it really all depends on how you design.\nyusheng kuo: I just say like cloud code have more configurability, it's more primitive compared to cloud.\nyusheng kuo: Open Cloud.\nyusheng kuo: Open cloud is like.\nyusheng kuo: He already put in a lot of moving pieces for you, right?\nyusheng kuo: So it's more like madness like a product, although it's not as consumer friendly yet.\nyusheng kuo: But like he, he assumed what you need and he tried to give that what you need.\nyusheng kuo: So like you don't.\nyusheng kuo: Well, you can.\nyusheng kuo: It's much harder to intervene what he is trying to do.\nyusheng kuo: You basically just trying to talk to it and hopefully he can finish it.\nyusheng kuo: It's harder to prepare a lot of context in open cloud compared to CloudCo.\nyusheng kuo: In CloudCo, it's very easy to drive the car.\nyusheng kuo: An open call is more like you have a personal assistant.\nyusheng kuo: He's doing one thing.\nLucky: Open cloud can assist us creating apps, web applications, web pages and everything.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nLucky: That capability may be missing in open Cloud.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know.\nyusheng kuo: I have not both can do it.\nyusheng kuo: It's just like in open Cloud, you kind of the major interface for you to control it is like through talking to it.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: But like it's, it's harder to like steer that because like he, he kind of would start to evaluate this is good and bad.\nyusheng kuo: Like he started to evaluate his own like memory of you.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like what he think you should want, you should do.\nyusheng kuo: But sometimes like you, you want like a very fresh start and like no memory, you just have very specific purpose and also large code base.\nyusheng kuo: Whatever the reason, OpenCloud is not designed for that yet.\nyusheng kuo: And then there's another thing is you have very poor shareability.\nyusheng kuo: Whatever you build the artifact can be shared.\nyusheng kuo: Like, oh, you create a PDF that PDF can be shared but your open clock cannot be shared with someone.\nyusheng kuo: Say like, okay, let's co Create something, let's co create a website, let's co create a marketing content with your colleague because there is no easy way to share that in your open call.\nyusheng kuo: And then you don't want to share it with people.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Because it's so personal.\nyusheng kuo: So that's another, another thing that's about open call.\nLucky: It's more like a personal assistant.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's very much oriented.\nyusheng kuo: So it's like, it's like a product.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So when I say product, it means it's not just a building block, it's like it's already a part of the aim to be your personal assistant.\nyusheng kuo: And that's a good thing.\nyusheng kuo: Like you have WhatsApp, you can he building a lot of things for that to be your personal assistant.\nyusheng kuo: But not like every time you want like a personal assistant, sometimes you need a colleague that you can have a group session and compare things, so on and so forth.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But I do see that this type of product will be coming a lot sooner than we expected.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: This is quite, very, very interesting product.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nLucky: The base, the AI is moving forward.\nLucky: It's, you know, I mean every week it's changing.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: But let's try to, let's try to.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: If you want to get into more of a nitty gritty part of how to build agent or you mentioned like a high level understanding of it because like we can do both.\nLucky: Yeah.\nLucky: At this moment I wanted to, you know how you create agent, how you, you know how you maximize the use of cloud code.\nLucky: You know how you can use to its full potential.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I actually feel open like cloud code by able to deploy them is actually very similar to the open cloud.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's possible.\nyusheng kuo: And then to some degree it's more powerful.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So I will start by.\nyusheng kuo: Let me know if you can see my screen or you can.\nyusheng kuo: Can you see my screen?\nLucky: Not yet.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, let me try to restart again.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: For some reason my, my Google Meet always kind of dropped.\nLucky: Yeah.\nLucky: Now it's Susan.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: So I create an artifact for you.\nyusheng kuo: It's on GitHub.\nyusheng kuo: I would really recommend you to get like basically do this like you go to GitHub and ask for CLI.\nyusheng kuo: The nice thing about using CLI is and then you should try to download for Mac or whatever.\nyusheng kuo: By the way, are you using Mac or Windows?\nLucky: I'm not using even Mac or Windows.\nLucky: I'm using Ubuntu.\nyusheng kuo: Ubuntu.\nLucky: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, okay.\nyusheng kuo: Awesome.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But it's basically a Mac related stuff.\nyusheng kuo: So it's very nice.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, cool.\nyusheng kuo: So.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, you just download the.\nyusheng kuo: So are you familiar with GitHub or can I skip this one?\nLucky: Yeah, I'm familiar with this.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, cool.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, then we don't need to.\nyusheng kuo: I just recommend like using download the GitHub CLI because then it's very quick to create a repo or doing things.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, but let's, let's get started.\nLucky: I've already installed it through cloud code command line.\nyusheng kuo: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So you know why it's important to use command line, right?\nyusheng kuo: Because whatever is in command line, like cloud cloud can natively use it through the bash screen.\nyusheng kuo: If you give it like a website asking to go to GitHub and then create a repo, it's very hard for them to do that reliably.\nyusheng kuo: Basically they have to control the browser but giving them command line they can do the same thing in much faster reliable way.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, always try to focus on command line if possible here.\nyusheng kuo: I also want to talk about quickly skim through what I feel like.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, like cloud code, a lot of people use them as like a vibe code like assistant, right.\nyusheng kuo: But the end product is some kind of dashboard, some kind of website.\nyusheng kuo: But I think it's actually anti parrot like for example open cloud.\nyusheng kuo: The nature of that is not a dashboard.\nyusheng kuo: He's actually using Agent to create an agent os.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And I think that's actually what cloud code is providing now is actually he also created this kind of agent OS that you can run on cloud code and then you use cloud code like harness to basically run things for you.\nyusheng kuo: So it's like Agent is at a core compared to the software is at the core.\nyusheng kuo: And then the difference how do they know is Agent is the core is that almost each request requires some kind of agent reasoning.\nyusheng kuo: If you interact with the open cloud, everything is through the agent, right?\nyusheng kuo: But if you use the agent to build something that is something most likely have nothing to do with agent, right?\nyusheng kuo: It's like the agent is only important while you are building that.\nyusheng kuo: So that's one thing like don't, don't.\nyusheng kuo: Where I see that actually anti pattern this is like you basically use just using Agent to build something like a 2015 thing, right?\nyusheng kuo: And there's a.\nyusheng kuo: In terms of a real implication I think first is like a.\nyusheng kuo: In Agent's OS you use code but use code as a tool.\nyusheng kuo: It's very lightweight, it's very small.\nyusheng kuo: Like oh, I need to fetch YouTube.\nyusheng kuo: You write a simple script to fetch the YouTube and then save it as a tool for the agent to use it so next time he doesn't need to rewrite the code again and again.\nyusheng kuo: So the code is tool.\nyusheng kuo: But compared to a traditional software, if you bycode something that becomes a monolithic code, right?\nyusheng kuo: Or like a workflow and now your context become the code.\nyusheng kuo: I think you're already familiar with that.\nyusheng kuo: Compared to like most of the software doesn't have the context.\nyusheng kuo: Everything is kind of stateless.\nyusheng kuo: And you can easily encode your domain knowledge, like your marketing understanding of how things should be done into the agent.\nyusheng kuo: That's something that like Clay couldn't do yet, right?\nyusheng kuo: Like Clay is a really good tool to run things in parallel, but it doesn't have the understanding of your domain knowledge.\nyusheng kuo: You have to basically encode that through the workflow building.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: If you're using clay.\nyusheng kuo: So that's why I say it's very hard to encode the dominology.\nyusheng kuo: You put in like a response and then become.\nyusheng kuo: The result is kind of very fragile.\nLucky: I can't see your screen now.\nLucky: I think you stop sharing it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, sorry.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So actually the agent OS is making you to achieve the goal in a very adaptive way.\nyusheng kuo: I have a very quick example here in my email the other day.\nyusheng kuo: Agent's output.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Here, today's fine.\nyusheng kuo: So here you see he actually saying there's a data collection issue, right?\nyusheng kuo: My NEON query actually timeout due to the NEON server, like slower at the time.\nyusheng kuo: So he couldn't fetch some of the data I wanted to fetch.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: But first he kind of notified this and then he tried to do some kind of workaround to solve this, but eventually he couldn't.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Because eventually as long as NEON is not up, he couldn't.\nyusheng kuo: But it doesn't stop it to do the rest of the thing like as normal.\nyusheng kuo: So he still tried to create a report and adapt the report based on whatever available information he can create it.\nyusheng kuo: So it's different from when everything is working normal.\nyusheng kuo: He can have all the tool everything, right.\nyusheng kuo: So it become very adaptive.\nyusheng kuo: It doesn't like if you use Play, right?\nyusheng kuo: You probably have used it then every time, like if there's a middle step is missing, he wouldn't do the next step.\nyusheng kuo: So the whole thing just broke like in, in the traditional software or dashboard.\nyusheng kuo: Most likely I would just like get nothing out of it.\nyusheng kuo: I wouldn't get this email at all because like one of the steps have the error.\nyusheng kuo: But using this agent os, like I, I wouldn't be able to.\nyusheng kuo: I like Agent as a Compute I can actually still get the result.\nyusheng kuo: So that's why like it's very adaptive.\nyusheng kuo: And one thing more is like it's very easy to extend because each agent is just adding some kind of context, adding some kind of English into it.\nyusheng kuo: So you don't need to write a code.\nyusheng kuo: So it's very powerful.\nyusheng kuo: So that's why I want first outreach.\nyusheng kuo: I said it's not helping you to write another code.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know what most of the course are teaching you.\nyusheng kuo: If they are teaching you how to use kaud to bytecode.\nyusheng kuo: To me that would be outdated in six months because no one really use a static dashboard.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like when you look at this email, oh, it's useful but like it's very minimal usage.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: The key thing is like I can see something and start to investigate something or you should even tell me what I should do next based on this.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: That's where the real value is.\nyusheng kuo: Or maybe you even finish that for me and it just need me to review.\nyusheng kuo: Like we have an agent actor will come in seeing what the error is and actually tell us what the error should be.\nyusheng kuo: So that's why I feel that you probably is already on the right track because you already coming into the context os.\nyusheng kuo: So that's like a high level here.\nyusheng kuo: I want to say how to build agent in a very quick sense.\nyusheng kuo: I have this kind of six principle.\nyusheng kuo: Do you need to understand what the difference between agent and skill is that something you feel confused or you're fine?\nLucky: Yeah, I want to understand this.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So to me agent encompass skill.\nyusheng kuo: So skill is like for example analyze product metric or generate PDF.\nyusheng kuo: That should be a skill.\nyusheng kuo: But the agent should be like a complete, a very specific end to end thing.\nyusheng kuo: Like for example doing my daily product overview.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And doing my product overview actually require one is like a product analytics skill and also email skill and also report generation skill to let the agent actually eventually create this like a beautiful like a dashboard for me.\nyusheng kuo: Like email for me.\nyusheng kuo: So that's where I see the difference between agent and skill.\nyusheng kuo: Does that make sense to you?\nyusheng kuo: So here, here's an example of it.\nLucky: So agent.\nLucky: So skill is like a brain for an agent.\nyusheng kuo: Skill is like I would say like like a muscle or like a tool for the agent.\nLucky: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So it doesn't.\nyusheng kuo: He doesn't need to like encode everything into the agents like one hand it make this agent become more like a software.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: He can have different dependency.\nyusheng kuo: Like I can update my product analysis and all the agent that depend on this skill get Updated.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Say if I don't have the skill I hard coded everything into the agent prompt, then I change one thing.\nyusheng kuo: I have to go ahead and change each of the agent that actually will require this product analysis skill.\nyusheng kuo: So it make it one is more context efficient and also a better dependency management.\nyusheng kuo: So whenever I improve my skill like everything get improved.\nyusheng kuo: Does that make sense?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nLucky: I can't see your screen again.\nyusheng kuo: I'm so sorry.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nLucky: Stop sharing after five minutes.\nyusheng kuo: No, no.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, let me actually don't share my screen.\nyusheng kuo: So maybe that would be better.\nyusheng kuo: I think it's my Google me issue.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's annoying.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so hopefully you can see now.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Now here is how to create agent.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So very quick like typical.\nyusheng kuo: You do agent, you do it by.\nyusheng kuo: So you do it by doing this.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Do you know this?\nyusheng kuo: Like you can create agent by doing this?\nLucky: I have not used this command as of now.\nLucky: I would love to know.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So basically you create this agent and you can create new agent and you can select project and generate with cloud is typically the, the thing to generate with the cloud.\nyusheng kuo: I can say hey, generate an agent to.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know to.\nyusheng kuo: To.\nyusheng kuo: To gather Tesla's stock price every day.\nLucky: So one question.\nLucky: You know I have not used this command but I just typed it just a comment that create a sales prospecting agent.\nLucky: And here are the guidelines.\nLucky: Use exa mcp, you know xray.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nLucky: So I asked now to use XA MCP and then whenever I'll be you sharing a company name or a link URL fetch the company details, their intent signals and key decision maker name and also the, the you know how I can approach them to market my services.\nLucky: So and then it created slash prospect as a command.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nLucky: So is that an agent?\nyusheng kuo: Oh so it's called comment.\nyusheng kuo: So there's another thing called like cust.\nyusheng kuo: Come in.\nLucky: So is that an agent that I created or it's just a command that.\nyusheng kuo: You know it's, it's a, it's a command.\nyusheng kuo: So.\nyusheng kuo: So in your.\nyusheng kuo: You should be able to see it actually from.\nyusheng kuo: Let me open my cursor.\nLucky: It just created all the files and then with all the guidelines and also without the guideline.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nLucky: One more thing I want to mention I asked Cloud Gold whenever I'll be calling this command slash prospect.\nLucky: So you know use this XMCP and then also use agent teams that recently been included in cloud.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nLucky: So that you know the one sub agent can work on creating a description for the company and the other agent can fit.\nLucky: Yeah intent signals and the third agent can find the details of the decision makers.\nLucky: So yes, it all should happen parallel using xmcp.\nLucky: So, wanted to know that.\nLucky: Have I created.\nLucky: Created an agent or just a command?\nyusheng kuo: Can I actually.\nyusheng kuo: Show me your screen.\nyusheng kuo: Is that possible?\nyusheng kuo: Like, can I take a look?\nyusheng kuo: It's probably easier for me to take a look.\nyusheng kuo: Let me stop because I'm not quite sure your process.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nLucky: Admission, my speed.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, But now every time, you have to manually, like, spin this agent up, right?\nyusheng kuo: Are you sharing.\nyusheng kuo: It?\nyusheng kuo: Hey, Lucky, are you still there?\nyusheng kuo: Hello?\nTitle: 30 Min Meeting between Yusheng Kuo and Luckish Rangra\nHost Email:
