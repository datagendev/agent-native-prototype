I have now one.\nAndriy Vovchak: One tool running and they like, kind of like.\nAndriy Vovchak: I think if I, If I disconnect it, it's gonna, it's gonna stop.\nAndriy Vovchak: Right?\nAndriy Vovchak: Because I'm running one custom tool.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, no, no, no.\nyusheng kuo: It's a separate thing.\nyusheng kuo: It doesn't matter.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, nice.\nAndriy Vovchak: So I can Delete it or disconnect it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, you can just delete it and re.\nyusheng kuo: Add it again.\nyusheng kuo: Disconnect.\nAndriy Vovchak: So I can select the repository Connect.\nAndriy Vovchak: Connect.\nyusheng kuo: Oh yeah, this is actually a bug because I think if it doesn't see anything, it doesn't get refreshed.\nyusheng kuo: So just thank, thank you for like letting us know because I think this is a part.\nyusheng kuo: So the thing you need to do is you can actually bring your own cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know if you know, you can actually if you go to your Kako.\nAndriy Vovchak: Or is it here.\nyusheng kuo: You open a new terminal.\nyusheng kuo: It has to be outside.\nyusheng kuo: Like in terminal, not in like cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, here.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So here you type cloud ciud.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, CIUD space.\nAndriy Vovchak: Ah, oh, sorry.\nAndriy Vovchak: Yeah, so let me close this one.\nAndriy Vovchak: Okay.\nAndriy Vovchak: Terminate.\nAndriy Vovchak: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, thank you so much for.\nyusheng kuo: Because you connect when you don't have agent and then that actually created age cases that we should handle.\nAndriy Vovchak: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Space setup token.\nyusheng kuo: S E T U P dash token.\nAndriy Vovchak: Token.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Enter.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then it will add you to authorized.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: And do you see?\nyusheng kuo: Actually you.\nyusheng kuo: You just need to basically copy this one and also copy the cloud co O token.\nyusheng kuo: That's the name of the API key.\nyusheng kuo: So I need to see the.\nyusheng kuo: Do you see the export like in the last line?\nyusheng kuo: No, the two line down you say cloud code oauth token.\nyusheng kuo: That would be the API key name.\nAndriy Vovchak: So what do you do with this one?\nAndriy Vovchak: Do I copy it or.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, you first need to copy the name.\nyusheng kuo: The cocos token name.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, just copy that name.\nAndriy Vovchak: Yeah, done.\nAndriy Vovchak: Huh.\nyusheng kuo: The coco oauth token.\nyusheng kuo: Just the API key name.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, just the key.\nyusheng kuo: The kauko token.\nAndriy Vovchak: Okay.\nAndriy Vovchak: The clock all tokens.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, because it has to be exactly the same name.\nyusheng kuo: So cal code.\nyusheng kuo: No like will parse it.\nyusheng kuo: So okay, now I need to.\nAndriy Vovchak: So what they need to do.\nyusheng kuo: No, you don't need to do it here because here you already get it.\nyusheng kuo: So you copy that and go to data gen.\nAndriy Vovchak: Okay.\nAndriy Vovchak: I go here and then paste it here.\nyusheng kuo: No, yeah sorry that you go out.\nyusheng kuo: You see the SAS secret here.\nyusheng kuo: It's the red line.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So you can ask secret.\nyusheng kuo: So you basically any kind of API key, you can actually bring it here.\nyusheng kuo: So this is like in deployment environment.\nyusheng kuo: So we have that kind of API key so we can run in cloud.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, so here's secret entropy.\nyusheng kuo: You couldn't put entropy's dash API key.\nyusheng kuo: You should put the all cloud oauth token.\nyusheng kuo: That's why I want you to copy the name.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, Cloud code has to use the only the.\nAndriy Vovchak: Yeah, only this one?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Only that one.\nyusheng kuo: The underscore.\nyusheng kuo: So you go up the secret name.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, no, no, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So it will be the secret nan should put the cloud co.\nyusheng kuo: Token.\nyusheng kuo: So here's a key value.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAndriy Vovchak: Oh, oh, okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAndriy Vovchak: So I take this one and I do it this way.\nyusheng kuo: You just.\nyusheng kuo: No, sorry.\nAndriy Vovchak: So here, for example, here you just.\nyusheng kuo: Put the cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Underscore.\nyusheng kuo: OAuth.\nyusheng kuo: OAuth underscore token.\nAndriy Vovchak: A club code.\nyusheng kuo: So, yeah, underscore.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nAndriy Vovchak: Underscore token and then equals.\nyusheng kuo: No, no, the, the value will be in the secret value.\nAndriy Vovchak: Ah, the.\nAndriy Vovchak: The secret value here.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAndriy Vovchak: This one.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: I think it's probably another confusing part.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: We actually just shipped the cli.\nyusheng kuo: So you can do everything like in cloud code, but we haven't fully passed it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, you paste that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Just try to, try to delete.\nyusheng kuo: Try to make sure.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, okay.\nyusheng kuo: Because sometimes we have a new space.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: And then you can give it a name like oauth tokens.\nyusheng kuo: So what this does is you will actually use your subscription instead of using the API key.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, so this is much cheaper.\nyusheng kuo: And then you go back to your.\nyusheng kuo: You hit the name home.\nAndriy Vovchak: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I go back to the agent.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, you just hit this one.\nyusheng kuo: So now you can route, can deploy it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then you can go down.\nyusheng kuo: I can try to introduce you a little bit.\nyusheng kuo: So here you say, you see that here's your prompt, your description.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And he will read the thing.\nyusheng kuo: And the thing is, you will have this kind of entry prompt, but entry prompt is not the prompt of the agent, but how you trigger this agent, you scroll further up.\nAndriy Vovchak: Have you triggered this agent?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Here's our default.\nyusheng kuo: We will say use this to respond to incoming payload.\nyusheng kuo: But if it's running a schedule, it depends on how you want to define it.\nyusheng kuo: If you want a slightly different way to give you more detail.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then, and then make sure you save it.\nAndriy Vovchak: So I leave it like this and I save it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: If you have you.\nyusheng kuo: How do you want to use this one?\nyusheng kuo: It's like a Chrome job, or I'm.\nAndriy Vovchak: Going to call it on the HTTP API via HTTP API here.\nyusheng kuo: I see.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nAndriy Vovchak: So because I, I tried to do it with the, with the custom tool, which is okay.\nAndriy Vovchak: Like it works, but it's, it's.\nAndriy Vovchak: Well, it's not that it's accurate, but it's not that doesn't have any reasoning as you can know.\nAndriy Vovchak: So I'm trying to.\nAndriy Vovchak: Yeah, so what, what they do they keep it like this?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So the payload will be basically you.\nyusheng kuo: You will be something like related to this agent.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: The the payload basically will be the body that will be coming in.\nyusheng kuo: For example, that will be the content that we send in.\nAndriy Vovchak: But what if I want to modify this agent, for example.\nyusheng kuo: Thank you.\nyusheng kuo: For example what like for example I.\nAndriy Vovchak: Want to change the copy here.\nAndriy Vovchak: I need to go modify it like on my cloth code and then push it.\nAndriy Vovchak: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, we.\nyusheng kuo: So tomorrow we will give you the CLI tool so you don't need to come in UI at all.\nyusheng kuo: So CLI will handle everything like including the deploy run and your agent will be able to cloud co will be able to see the result as well.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, good.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah we would do the test today and then tomorrow you would do it and then.\nyusheng kuo: So you don't need to come here to or like update here.\nyusheng kuo: Do you want to actually update here like if possible?\nAndriy Vovchak: Yeah, it will be maybe.\nAndriy Vovchak: Yeah it would be nice because for example I just learned that they like cloud code.\nAndriy Vovchak: Like has built the prompts but for it has built it for cloud code.\nAndriy Vovchak: Because you see like it access like all this stuff here and then.\nAndriy Vovchak: Yeah, because I can deploy it actually I can because I can use it within cloud code.\nAndriy Vovchak: But I think I will not able to use it within.\nyusheng kuo: Like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So basically you want to send this to the to payload so you can try to run it.\nyusheng kuo: So you can copy this one.\nyusheng kuo: I can show you how to run it.\nyusheng kuo: Actually you can test in.\nyusheng kuo: In the environment.\nyusheng kuo: There's a code run now if you go to agent you can basically this run now lets you test it.\nyusheng kuo: So you just paste your payload here and then you will be able to see what the result look like.\nAndriy Vovchak: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nAndriy Vovchak: So it's.\nAndriy Vovchak: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So for example, if you clay was sent into like this like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, Yeah yeah.\nyusheng kuo: You could.\nyusheng kuo: So how is this different from like a clay like clay gen?\nyusheng kuo: What do you need to.\nAndriy Vovchak: It's way, way cheaper first of all.\nAndriy Vovchak: And they have like full control of everything that I want.\nAndriy Vovchak: And by the way this is like it's not gonna be a practice.\nAndriy Vovchak: No, it is.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: We, we.\nyusheng kuo: We.\nyusheng kuo: We now have some scaling issue.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, we are actively working on it.\nyusheng kuo: So you can like running like, like, like like fast enough.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So bear with us and you will be the first one and it's free for you to run this agent like other than other than your cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: Like substitution.\nAndriy Vovchak: Indeed.\nAndriy Vovchak: Did execution status running okay.\nAndriy Vovchak: This like actually so great to be honest too.\nAndriy Vovchak: And so if I Want to modify the agent I need to rebuild it on so I can say like, hey, listen, yeah, you build.\nAndriy Vovchak: Because you see that it has built the agent, but it's build agent for cloud code, not for what it receives on Glade.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, can go there if you want to try.\nyusheng kuo: I can give you.\nyusheng kuo: Can I share my screen?\nAndriy Vovchak: Yes.\nAndriy Vovchak: Yeah, sure.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So we actually just created this one.\nyusheng kuo: I didn't give you the.\nyusheng kuo: We are like it's not tested, but if you, if you.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, you can test it too.\nyusheng kuo: So basically first let me send you the.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, sorry, this is a big one already.\nyusheng kuo: She's sick so she's sleeping with me separate from this brother.\nyusheng kuo: So you can actually install here, let me.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, sorry, I didn't share it.\nAndriy Vovchak: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so let me give you this.\nyusheng kuo: You see, so, so this one would lead you to this one and if you are using Mac, then yeah, you can just download this basically just like a cloud Pro.\nyusheng kuo: And then you just need to do Data Gen Login MCP if you have an MCP and you can do like a GitHub Connect here you can do GitHub repo.\nyusheng kuo: So, so you basically just give this data CLI to cloud code and then ask it to run like a dash dash help.\nyusheng kuo: It will show everything.\nyusheng kuo: So you can see once.\nyusheng kuo: So you can basically do everything in cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: So you don't need to go to our ui.\nyusheng kuo: You can connect the repo, you can do the sync.\nyusheng kuo: So every time you finish the development locally you can, can just sync it and then you can deploy that directly from the cli and then you can run it like you ask it to give it like a payload.\nyusheng kuo: So here's just your agent ID and agent id just when you do the list deploy, you can see your agent ID and then you can see the payload.\nyusheng kuo: So he would run and then he would basically see the result of the vlog.\nyusheng kuo: So everything is kind of not going right.\nyusheng kuo: The cloud code can like handle it themselves.\nAndriy Vovchak: Okay.\nAndriy Vovchak: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: So you don't, you don't need to come into like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's, that's our kind of a solution for that.\nyusheng kuo: So you can like a GitHub get push and then just.\nyusheng kuo: And then like directly I could run the agent again to see the result.\nyusheng kuo: So the, the goal is you don't need to come to a datajet ui.\nAndriy Vovchak: That's incredible.\nyusheng kuo: And you can set secret here too.\nAndriy Vovchak: And the agent is also like giving like an inside insane result by the way.\nAndriy Vovchak: Okay, my man, I truly appreciate this, but please go, go to sleep.\nAndriy Vovchak: Go to your kids.\nAndriy Vovchak: It's like 2:00am for you, so.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, sorry.\nAndriy Vovchak: We can catch up in the evening.\nAndriy Vovchak: So for me, the evening for you would be like tomorrow.\nAndriy Vovchak: Tomorrow.\nyusheng kuo: It's really like.\nyusheng kuo: Thank you.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Thank you so much for.\nyusheng kuo: For giving us this feedback.\nAndriy Vovchak: I mean, I. Super happy.\nAndriy Vovchak: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nAndriy Vovchak: Take care.\nAndriy Vovchak: Moment.\nAndriy Vovchak: See you.\nyusheng kuo: Thank you.\nyusheng kuo: Bye.\nAndriy Vovchak: For you.\nAndriy Vovchak: Take care.\nyusheng kuo: Take care.\nyusheng kuo: By.\nTitle: https://meet.google.com/yzf-binn-nep\nHost Email: No host email\nOrganizer Email: yusheng.kuo@datagen.dev\nCalendar Id: No calendar id\nFireflies Users: yusheng.kuo@datagen.dev\nParticipants: yusheng.kuo@datagen.dev\nDate: 1771317000000\nTranscript Url: https://app.fireflies.ai/view/01KHNBJ9MAEQ070MBFP77EDRCR\nAudio Url: https://cdn.fireflies.ai/01KHNBJ9MAEQ070MBFP77EDRCR/audio.mp3?Expires=1771534229&Policy=eyJTdGF0ZW1lbnQiOlt7IlJlc291cmNlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9jZG4uZmlyZWZsaWVzLmFpLzAxS0hOQko5TUFFUTA3ME1CRlA3N0VEUkNSL2F1ZGlvLm1wMyIsIkNvbmRpdGlvbiI6eyJEYXRlTGVzc1RoYW4iOnsiQVdTOkVwb2NoVGltZSI6MTc3MTUzNDIyOX19fV19&Signature=I7BOKglphbiJreHGGjYX45Zc9Gs01Q3Wz2x5tKlCJmHvJ1gx-nkbscMntR~-ogcf3o7B5JokHN297WiLB18fcPD~ChKKISU-lp7FRaGf0-3LhcMsooDBhgydkr-2Nn8uUKZRmpqLzHx6M52AmRcSGcqJhnygNW9AJkrH64H9-ruQFri9b45GvzI~RMgdS-5GhRiH6Jg4XSyKHWpHTExWdiqGGHoeNc5aJXROzch1fZW6XIO5oYCWsJMdID63~SqcVJm3cHasVUHQW8BzBF-7XT-T99pnCmjLvde9XjB8kEzjGVfkfH5IUj0uOvx0nT1TlXiqt9LaxwMb4VYxvCiq5w__&Key-Pair-Id=K25ZJR0UZVF4CM\nVideo Url: No video url\nDuration: 19.3700008392334\nMeeting Attendees: No meeting attendees\nCal Id: No cal id\nCalendar Type: No calendar type\nMeeting Link: https://meet.google.com/yzf-binn-nep"
