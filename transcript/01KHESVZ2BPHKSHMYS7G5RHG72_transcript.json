Martinis: Yeah.\nScott Martinis: I, I'm actually just writing, working on, writing a memo with Claude code on some of the big agent changes.\nScott Martinis: I don't, I don't think everyone, I think everyone sees open claw and exaction as a gimmick.\nScott Martinis: Or it's like, oh, single, you can have big single founder companies versus like no, no, you don't understand.\nScott Martinis: No agent employees are here and they will be, there will be mass market adoption by the end of the year.\nScott Martinis: And it's like.\nScott Martinis: And you need to be, if whoever you are, you need to be thinking about your AI literacy and whether you're going good 100.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, even I, I would say I.\nyusheng kuo: I thought I myself like at very like, I would say I kind of.\nyusheng kuo: Tried to stay.\nyusheng kuo: Like in the know but it's still very hard.\nyusheng kuo: Like even like open cloud.\nyusheng kuo: I, it's really surprised me.\nyusheng kuo: I actually, to be honest, I haven't really like installed like playing around with it, but I feel anxious that I haven't because a lot of time you, you, it's easy to judge or command.\nyusheng kuo: Like there's a guy who keeps like asking like what.\nyusheng kuo: What's the best show about open cloud?\nyusheng kuo: Like just a cloud code with some kind of a trigger layer, a crown layer.\nyusheng kuo: But I feel a lot of things like if you don't use it, you don't feel it and then you will have a very biased or incomplete feeling.\nyusheng kuo: Like a cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: Before I use cloud code I was like, ah, I probably don't need it.\nyusheng kuo: I just use cursor.\nyusheng kuo: That's fine for me.\nyusheng kuo: And then when I use cloud code it's just a lot of latent behaviors start to emerge that I didn't expect.\nyusheng kuo: That's what I feel like a lot of things.\nyusheng kuo: If they called the fire, they must have something that's very under the surface that actually get people very excited and like, like Apple, like Apple iPhone.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But one thing I, I do, this is something I, I personally feel it is like this type of a personal assistant.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Is like a layer one and it's just like the, the modern economy.\nScott Martinis: Like everyone I wanna, I wanna, I wanna highlight.\nScott Martinis: It's not just a personal assistant.\nScott Martinis: So here's the thing.\nScott Martinis: Personal assistant, framing and agent.\nScott Martinis: The thing is what happened last year is companies shipped a bunch of stuff they called agents.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nScott Martinis: That were glorified chatbots or workflows with SaaS interfaces.\nScott Martinis: Yeah, yeah, none of that other than cursor.\nScott Martinis: None of the agents could write code ad hoc.\nScott Martinis: Like I was talking to Claude and I was like, hey, what do you think about using Notion?\nScott Martinis: And my cloud bot is called Archie.\nScott Martinis: And he's like, I don't want to do it.\nScott Martinis: I was like, well, why do you not like this?\nScott Martinis: He's like, well this is funny.\nScott Martinis: Like he.\nScott Martinis: To explain his point, he wrote out the function call for Supabase versus Notion and hidden was just obvious.\nScott Martinis: Like well yeah, this is a really complicated API call, but this is really simplicated and so like the thing we don't appreciate is if you have a native agent employee code is their native language.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nScott Martinis: And that is something you're going to have.\nScott Martinis: AI employees are essentially a coding agent.\nScott Martinis: Well, it's not.\nScott Martinis: No, no, you're not coding agents.\nScott Martinis: This is, I got, I got Claude to do detailed behavioral and neural psychology on me.\nScott Martinis: An executive coach.\nScott Martinis: You have an agent that within the scope of its responsibility is within the top 10% of humans in any field of human endeavor.\nScott Martinis: The only, the only limit it has is it's memory and it's context window.\nScott Martinis: Basically.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But I feel, I feel there's a.\nyusheng kuo: I can give you example.\nyusheng kuo: So I agree with you.\nyusheng kuo: So when I, when I say coding.\nyusheng kuo: Agent, I'm not saying like they can.\nyusheng kuo: Do coding, but it's like the framework will all be merged like LangChain everyone, all the like a framework will be.\nyusheng kuo: Merged into this kind of a coding agent which is like an agent living OS instead of agent with a bunch.\nyusheng kuo: Of a peripheral pool.\nyusheng kuo: But the second layer I am thinking now is you how like, like for example, I, I try to create a.\nyusheng kuo: Contract for one of my clients.\nyusheng kuo: I, I can use cloud code to create a contract, but I have no.\nyusheng kuo: Way to verify the output whether it's.\nyusheng kuo: Legally binded or what.\nyusheng kuo: So what I want is actually I want to have ability to access an.\nyusheng kuo: Expert agent that's probably providing by the.\nyusheng kuo: Legal provider or like I have a sales pipeline.\nScott Martinis: Oh, for legal, for legal content.\nScott Martinis: That's.\nScott Martinis: That's.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: It's like, it's not like saying like cloud code doesn't have ability to come up with the knowledge, but because I don't have that verifier that living within me.\nyusheng kuo: Like if it's a coding related capability, I can verify it, but it's like legal if it's a sales.\nyusheng kuo: If it's a marketing, I want to delegate to the expert agent that I.\nyusheng kuo: Can actually access his service.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: I think that's why I feel like.\nyusheng kuo: When I say earlier I say there's.\nyusheng kuo: A personal assistant which is like knowing everything about you but not necessarily have.\nyusheng kuo: Because your Context.\nyusheng kuo: You build up your context.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So you are actually limited by your own ability to know how to.\nScott Martinis: I'm calling it context links.\nyusheng kuo: Context what?\nScott Martinis: Context link.\nScott Martinis: Like that's the key to getting agents to be effective in 2020 in my view.\nScott Martinis: Agents they have such large, they have, they're, they're so cognitively effective and they have such large context windows.\nScott Martinis: You don't need to build a really complex rag structured database.\nyusheng kuo: No, no.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nScott Martinis: You just throw a bunch of files and it'll figure it out now.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nScott Martinis: Explanation of what the files are and you need them to be good quality and stuff because it will hallucinate.\nScott Martinis: It will assume anything in the files is accurate.\nScott Martinis: See if so so that's important but.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, but, but that's still, that's still like one is like so okay.\nyusheng kuo: So I think my view is there is a two worldview right.\nyusheng kuo: It's like okay I have.\nyusheng kuo: My relationship would be me and like the agent provider and everything I need.\nyusheng kuo: Is provided by this agent provider his.\nyusheng kuo: Own like a pre training knowledge, whatever.\nyusheng kuo: But there's another view is there's a network.\nyusheng kuo: So I, I.\nyusheng kuo: My personal agent is very capable but he doesn't know like how to do sales properly.\nyusheng kuo: He doesn't have the framework like the.\nyusheng kuo: Other day you posted about how you actually come up with a way to extract some kind of insight.\nyusheng kuo: I even I could talk to Cloud like all day.\nyusheng kuo: I wouldn't be able to come up with that kind of framework.\nyusheng kuo: And I would want to access your.\nyusheng kuo: Framework, your agent who has been built.\nyusheng kuo: Up the town one.\nyusheng kuo: Because the reason is first there will be proprietary data.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: If I want to do real estate.\nyusheng kuo: Agent I need to have access to.\nyusheng kuo: Mls but I don't like I don't have a license but if I can talk to a real estate agent he had the access to the tool and it makes sense for them to own.\nyusheng kuo: The tool even they have to pay.\nyusheng kuo: A bunch of money because they providing that service.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So that's like how do you distribute it that kind of agent service.\nyusheng kuo: So one day you can wrap up.\nyusheng kuo: Your understanding of how to do sales.\nyusheng kuo: How to do pipeline wrap up as a service through the agent.\nyusheng kuo: That will be 247 people can access through.\nyusheng kuo: They're just sending an email like I sending you a CFC of my.\nyusheng kuo: Or maybe I just send you hey I need to help me to generate.\nyusheng kuo: The pipeline and you will send me back with just.\nyusheng kuo: You probably ask my agent about some question about me.\nyusheng kuo: You probably already will pull my my.\nyusheng kuo: When I first email you.\nyusheng kuo: You already do some kind of lead routing and then do some kind of enrichment and.\nyusheng kuo: But you probably still need some kind.\nyusheng kuo: Of question about me and you ask me my agent will respond because my.\nyusheng kuo: Agent have the content about me but your agent have a content of the framework and then the verification and the tools and the skill that I don't.\nyusheng kuo: Have time to build up myself and I wouldn't want to build on myself in the end.\nyusheng kuo: So that's like how do I.\nyusheng kuo: How do you provide that service?\nyusheng kuo: I mean maybe just through the email.\nyusheng kuo: Maybe there's no need any kind of a to a like interface.\nyusheng kuo: It's just an email that's human and.\nyusheng kuo: Because one thing I really care is like a parity like my.\nyusheng kuo: Whatever my agent can see, I should be able to see it too, right?\nyusheng kuo: So I can anytime like intervene just like autopilot in terms of.\nScott Martinis: That's something that I have started doing with not entirely but I got Claude to do a lot of context logging or not a context logging.\nScott Martinis: I got it to write and save session transcripts really quickly.\nScott Martinis: I got a bunch of hooks around pre compaction working.\nScott Martinis: What's your business by the way?\nScott Martinis: Tell me what you do, man.\nyusheng kuo: So we are actually trying to help.\nyusheng kuo: People to easily deploy their cloud code agent.\nyusheng kuo: So you create an agent in cloud code, right?\nyusheng kuo: Basically slash cloud slash agents or skills.\nyusheng kuo: We just want you to be easily.\nyusheng kuo: Like so so the high level is like we try to be the infrastructure layer of agent operation.\nyusheng kuo: So the first step we have the MCB gateway so you can easily add.\nyusheng kuo: Tool that's a one layer of infrastructure.\nyusheng kuo: And now what we are doing is.\nyusheng kuo: Actually we add the deployment so you can easily deploy your calcul agent which.\nyusheng kuo: Is running locally to run 24.\nyusheng kuo: 7 and then it can accept the webhook.\nyusheng kuo: You can just one click and deploy that.\nyusheng kuo: So like your fireflies can send a webhook to your agent.\nyusheng kuo: And then I think next what we are doing is also adding the communication layer, right?\nyusheng kuo: So we have the email.\nyusheng kuo: So every time after the agent finish it will send you an email about.\nyusheng kuo: The output but you can also reply.\nyusheng kuo: To resume this conversation.\nyusheng kuo: So so basically you can email back this agent to talk to it and then get an answer back.\nyusheng kuo: And I think next would be the.\nyusheng kuo: Transaction layer, the identity layer.\nyusheng kuo: That's all thing.\nyusheng kuo: That's how can we make it super easy for the agent that you created to be operational across the world.\nyusheng kuo: One thing I'm thinking actually what I really want now is okay, I have an agent.\nyusheng kuo: How do I provide this agent as.\nyusheng kuo: A service and this email agent actually.\nyusheng kuo: Become very effective because you can have agents, this agent of your email become the agents of your.\nyusheng kuo: The way to interact with your agent.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: I just send you the email and.\nyusheng kuo: Then based on the content, my agent will basically send you back the result.\nyusheng kuo: I can attach a CSV, whatever.\nyusheng kuo: And then on your side you just.\nyusheng kuo: Need to add people who's allowed in this email list.\nyusheng kuo: So that's one thing.\nyusheng kuo: And then if you have this kind.\nyusheng kuo: Of email as a communication layer, right.\nyusheng kuo: I chose email because email is almost like the most universal communication layer in the world.\nyusheng kuo: Like a.\nyusheng kuo: Better than SMS, better than WhatsApp.\nyusheng kuo: It has 6 billion people using it and then it's open standard.\nyusheng kuo: Like it's not owned by any kind of corporate.\nyusheng kuo: So like what if I can just.\nyusheng kuo: Like basically say like my contract issue, I can actually ask my email, ask my agent, send an email to whatever.\nyusheng kuo: Agent in, in the network and then.\nyusheng kuo: Ask him about how to do the contract based on my situation.\nyusheng kuo: And then the agent will email back right to me.\nyusheng kuo: And then we will probably have a.\nyusheng kuo: Contract that I can sign and I will pay.\nyusheng kuo: And then once they pay then the.\nyusheng kuo: The agent would just say okay, you paid, I verify you paid.\nyusheng kuo: And then now here's your contract that we created for you.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then because that contract agent have the legal people who have understanding how.\nyusheng kuo: To do a legal, how to do a verified verification, they probably have some.\nyusheng kuo: Hook to do some redlining.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: That I have no idea how to do.\nyusheng kuo: So they can create a real, to.\nyusheng kuo: Me that's where the real agent economy coming in.\nyusheng kuo: Because if every agent I need to.\nyusheng kuo: Do it myself, that would be like so time consuming and it would be so ineffective.\nScott Martinis: Agent factory.\nScott Martinis: You need to build an agent factory.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, but like how do I manage the.\nScott Martinis: Yeah, go ahead.\nyusheng kuo: Even, even I have the agent factory.\nyusheng kuo: Most of them will probably be mediocre, right?\nyusheng kuo: Because I wouldn't have so much time.\nyusheng kuo: To fine tune each of them.\nScott Martinis: You need an agent manager.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, no, but, but, but it's like if every agent is based on the.\nyusheng kuo: Context of knowing me, then the upper.\nyusheng kuo: Limit is how well I know or how I can verify Kau's output.\nyusheng kuo: But if I can have an external agent that I can communicate to, then I basically hire him.\nyusheng kuo: Like the other agent is the employee, right?\nyusheng kuo: And you can provide this agent as a service.\nyusheng kuo: Then I pay you for the agent and you, you give me because you have this unique exclusive access to certain.\nyusheng kuo: Tool, certain data set, certain understanding of the context, certain skills.\nyusheng kuo: So I don't need to like it's.\nyusheng kuo: Just like the news to me.\nyusheng kuo: That's a new SaaS.\nyusheng kuo: Like I don't want to.\nyusheng kuo: I mean yeah of course like everyone.\nyusheng kuo: Can do SaaS, but I don't want.\nyusheng kuo: To because like everyone should be dedicated.\nyusheng kuo: To actually make these agents so good and then that can actually just provide me as a service and I can I just like go to the restaurant to have a meal.\nyusheng kuo: I just ask this agent to do.\nyusheng kuo: My tax instead of building my own.\nyusheng kuo: Tax agent who might be very error born.\nyusheng kuo: That's, that's actually where I see this is going to go in that beyond just like a limitation of personal assistant or like what you can do yourself.\nScott Martinis: Yeah, that makes sense.\nScott Martinis: So your business is creating and deploying agents.\nScott Martinis: Like how can I help?\nScott Martinis: What's your biggest focus for right now?\nScott Martinis: What's it, what's your biggest focus for right now?\nScott Martinis: What are you trying to solve for?\nyusheng kuo: So actually what we want to do is we want to right now our first offer is we want to help.\nyusheng kuo: Agency to package their service into this.\nyusheng kuo: Agent and then say for example like Jeremy, right.\nyusheng kuo: He already, already have some client doing.\nyusheng kuo: Some kind of wrap up being like using clay.\nyusheng kuo: But they can, the first step they.\nyusheng kuo: Can upsell like they say okay, I, I create this agent in my repository and then you need to buy this repository.\nScott Martinis: That's actually not going to be the best use case for most people.\nScott Martinis: How so you shouldn't upsell an agent.\nyusheng kuo: Shouldn't or should.\nyusheng kuo: Why I would want to know.\nScott Martinis: Here's the thing that creates an enormous amount of risk and friction for clients.\nScott Martinis: So you know what my team did is my team, my GDM engineer, he on his own used CLAUDE code to build agents that basically make it connects easier.\nScott Martinis: He can basically write a CLAUDE code table for himself and he, he can essentially write, he can essentially write a, a clay table in like 80 less time.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nScott Martinis: So the thing, the actual lever is like look, you still need humans reviewing the output.\nScott Martinis: Just get ages.\nScott Martinis: How is anthropic?\nScott Martinis: How is it.\nScott Martinis: Why is anthropic?\nScott Martinis: Higher engineers.\nScott Martinis: They're hiring agent managers.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nScott Martinis: So that the actual best way to get them into production is get them agent.\nScott Martinis: Get agents deployed that give them more capacity and help them start packaging their standard operating procedures into agents.\nScott Martinis: Because what this means is like sure you could because here's the thing, what are people buying?\nScott Martinis: Look, the buyer does not give a.\nScott Martinis: How their ads get.\nScott Martinis: They want their ads to get managed.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nScott Martinis: So the easiest way to do this is just going to be so look, food for thought for you.\nScott Martinis: Feel free to not think about this.\nScott Martinis: I.\nScott Martinis: What I would love.\nScott Martinis: I think there might be an interesting trade here which is I need help on my agent architecture.\nScott Martinis: I'm not enveloper by nature.\nScott Martinis: Like I'm pretty happy with some of the stuff I shipped in my repo.\nScott Martinis: But yeah, yeah, I want to get this.\nScott Martinis: I think I've worked in B2B and with.\nScott Martinis: I. I got my start in agencies eight years ago.\nScott Martinis: So I know the agency based decently well.\nScott Martinis: Right.\nScott Martinis: And I can, I can.\nScott Martinis: There's a few there.\nScott Martinis: If you want marketing agencies I can recommend a few Facebook groups for.\nScott Martinis: For this and I think you can.\nScott Martinis: I think I can maybe help you on the selling and positioning this better way.\nScott Martinis: So if you're interested I'd be open to doing some sort of trade here.\nyusheng kuo: Can be more like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, can be more like.\nScott Martinis: How many clients do you have and how many you want to get to?\nyusheng kuo: Sorry, what is it?\nScott Martinis: How many clients do you have and how many clients do you want to get to?\nyusheng kuo: So we now currently in talk with.\nyusheng kuo: Three try to cross three and we want to I at least like this.\nyusheng kuo: In the coming two months we want to expand it to 20 if we can be able to see this repetitive motion.\nyusheng kuo: I But I think the key thing is.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, what so so now the.\nyusheng kuo: The our basically how this.\nyusheng kuo: How our kind of.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know what's the word?\nyusheng kuo: Maybe that's how our like a business model is.\nyusheng kuo: We provide the technical support to agency like.\nyusheng kuo: Like.\nyusheng kuo: Right, like a Jeremy and he crept up the Calco agent that can run on Chrome.\nScott Martinis: Who was this?\nyusheng kuo: Jeremy Ross.\nScott Martinis: Oh yeah, yeah.\nScott Martinis: Okay.\nScott Martinis: So you know Jeremy.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So he created up this kind of agent.\nyusheng kuo: This agent now is doing something fairly straightforward.\nyusheng kuo: It's like this agent will read the.\nyusheng kuo: CRM data and then based on the content, based on the guideline so he can update the guideline whatever he want.\nyusheng kuo: And because the way it create agent.\nyusheng kuo: In cloud code is super easy, right?\nyusheng kuo: You basically just describe it and then.\nyusheng kuo: This agent because it will run on cronk job and then he can have.\nyusheng kuo: All the access to the repo and the tool, right?\nyusheng kuo: So he will every day will send out this email to the account executive to say okay, who should you contact, who should you prioritize?\nyusheng kuo: And then people can email back, right.\nyusheng kuo: So basically they use the email right now to interact with this agent.\nyusheng kuo: So this agent service or business become a business like a business for Jeremy and it will be the part of.\nyusheng kuo: The product for the full client to use it.\nyusheng kuo: And on our hand it's like we.\nyusheng kuo: Can teach like Jeremy like one time, right.\nyusheng kuo: And then Jeremy, when you scale to.\nyusheng kuo: Different client, then it's kind of like.\nyusheng kuo: A clay, I would say a very similar play of clay.\nyusheng kuo: Like because clay is too complicated directly.\nyusheng kuo: To sell to the end customers.\nyusheng kuo: So they have this kind of middle agents layer to teach them and then they help them to scale.\nyusheng kuo: So that's what kind of our play now is like we teach like agency because we provide this very easy infrastructure to deploy agent, create and deploy agent.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nScott Martinis: Point I'm making is I can remove.\nScott Martinis: I don't want a lot of your time right now.\nScott Martinis: The big thing I think I can help.\nScott Martinis: I don't want a lot of your time.\nScott Martinis: I basically want a developer that I can bounce off ideas off of.\nScott Martinis: The thing is a lot of how you're, a lot of how you're, I think positioning this.\nScott Martinis: I, I, you said you're look, if you're not interested.\nyusheng kuo: No, no, no, no.\nyusheng kuo: Just I, I want it to be very off from, very direct.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: This is the short, no hiding.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nScott Martinis: So it, it is the short answer.\nScott Martinis: I can look at your current sales and marketing efforts and in a few minutes tell you if something is like you said, I don't know how to evaluate sales and marketing outputs.\nScott Martinis: I do.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, exactly.\nScott Martinis: And if you're trying to grow this customer base, I know the agencies face pretty well.\nScott Martinis: I've actually had two agency coaching programs as clients, so I understand it pretty intimately.\nScott Martinis: And so I know what they buy and what they don't and how they sell.\nScott Martinis: Like all this stuff is very familiar to me.\nScott Martinis: So I can significantly de risk the learning cycles and business model and engagement model for you so that you can more effectively package, sell and market your services to agencies.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nScott Martinis: And I'm not like, I'm not, I'm not promising anything crazy here.\nScott Martinis: I'm just like, hey, well like a lot of this is probably gonna end up being prompt swapping.\nScott Martinis: Like hey, true.\nScott Martinis: Yeah, like it's like, hey dude, like I'm envisioning, hey, let's talk for 30 minutes a week and all.\nScott Martinis: Or an hour a week.\nScott Martinis: We'll figure it out.\nScott Martinis: I'll show you what I've got on my side.\nScott Martinis: Like here's what I'm working on and then I'll.\nScott Martinis: You show me what you've got on your side.\nScott Martinis: Like the first thing I would suggest you need to do is you need to coalesce.\nScott Martinis: The first thing actually you should do is you should read or get a copy of $100 million, offers, and you should run through that entire exercise for your customers.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nScott Martinis: First thing I'd suggest, and then like, let's meet in a couple days.\nScott Martinis: If you wanted to start this, I would say run that.\nScott Martinis: Let's meet in a couple days.\nScott Martinis: And you should like, you show me your first pass and I'll critique it or even send me Async.\nScott Martinis: And then like on my side, it's like, hey, let me have Archie give you a summary of the our current context repo or try to find a safe version of this that's in a fork because there's some private stuff.\nScott Martinis: I don't necessarily want to share a client data and stuff like that.\nScott Martinis: Talk to me like, hey, what, what should I do?\nScott Martinis: Like, I'm trying to get the Slack integration to work.\nScott Martinis: I want to improve the memory architecture and I need to know when to move into multi agent.\nScott Martinis: And I also can't get cloud teams working.\nScott Martinis: So there's like little things that I'm trying to ship that are like, take some more brain work for me.\nScott Martinis: And I love your perspective how to do that.\nScott Martinis: So that's what I'm kind of, what I'm offering here is it's like, okay.\nyusheng kuo: So you, you share it with the.\nyusheng kuo: The sales and marketing side, I share with the technical side.\nScott Martinis: Is that exactly right?\nScott Martinis: Because if I can.\nScott Martinis: Or maybe we throw this in Slack.\nScott Martinis: Like, if I was like, dude, I'm stuck on this.\nScott Martinis: And you're like, hey, I just had this prospect talk.\nScott Martinis: Talk to me.\nScott Martinis: Like, what does this mean?\nScott Martinis: It's like, oh, throw this in Claude.\nScott Martinis: Sort of throw the transcript in Claude website and do this prompt and then tell me what comes out.\nScott Martinis: Like, that's the kind of stuff I'm envisioning because that's something that like, brother, dude, I can just, I can just send a freaking voice note and you, you take a transcript and like, you know that's.\nScott Martinis: I'm a very, very fast reader, right?\nScott Martinis: And so like, you could you show me one of those things and I'll tell you.\nScott Martinis: Like, you know, this is what's happening, right?\nyusheng kuo: So what do you.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so let's try to see, okay.\nyusheng kuo: What would be the content or material.\nyusheng kuo: That we need to share with each other?\nyusheng kuo: Like, can you, can you can like, what's.\nyusheng kuo: What do you need for me?\nyusheng kuo: What, what do you need from me.\nyusheng kuo: For you to give me like some.\nyusheng kuo: Kind of construct check advice?\nScott Martinis: It's going to vary, dude.\nScott Martinis: It's going to vary.\nScott Martinis: And some of this I won't even necessarily need to see it.\nScott Martinis: Like, you just describing the problem might be enough.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nScott Martinis: Single, the single most valuable, what I suspect is probably going to happen is proposal documents.\nScott Martinis: And we can do it and the mnda, if you want proposal documents, sales call transcripts and like maybe website or web pages.\nScott Martinis: Right?\nScott Martinis: Because ultimately what you're going to want to do is you're going to want to collect, you're going to want to take one core offer and you're going to want to collapse your whole solution into one core offer that, that you can sell to agents.\nyusheng kuo: Right, right, right.\nyusheng kuo: It's a very direct, like I just help you to solve this.\nyusheng kuo: Not like, oh, I have this as a feature.\nScott Martinis: Yeah, yeah.\nScott Martinis: Well, because the thing is, it's like the thing is this, you know, you're offering these people.\nScott Martinis: I think you need to think carefully about the positioning problem because everyone's heard about agents and they're largely useless, right?\nScott Martinis: Not useless, but they've been.2% of agent deployments succeeded last year.\nScott Martinis: Something like that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nScott Martinis: And there's something new and you need to explain how agent employees with persistent memory are a new opportunity.\nScott Martinis: Right?\nScott Martinis: Agent employees and agent workflows are a new opportunity and it is possible to get them to work.\nScott Martinis: And here's how to get it to work.\nScott Martinis: Work.\nScott Martinis: And so like the, the, the first thing I, you know, the first, that's a lot of this is like you give me web pages and sales calls or we hop on a call where you send me a voice note.\nScott Martinis: I can work with that.\nScott Martinis: Like that's, that, that's one of the.\nScott Martinis: So, so for context about how is it I was able to do this?\nScott Martinis: I basically reworked someone's entire top of, from 90 cold call conversations and 15 sales calls and then some.\nScott Martinis: I, I, I had like 10 docs on their sales bundle.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nScott Martinis: I threw all that code, I did a bunch of prompts, I looked at it.\nScott Martinis: I rewrote the first call deck, I rewrote follow up tips decks.\nScott Martinis: I created a bit collateral to help with business cases.\nScott Martinis: I created a customized coaching plan for the prospect.\nScott Martinis: Like that, that's like you're selling that you're selling the market.\nScott Martinis: I don't really want to sell right now.\nScott Martinis: I might be interested.\nScott Martinis: Agencies have a huge problem packaging their services.\nScott Martinis: And so and I also don't have their skill set.\nScott Martinis: So like, hey, look, there might be a world where I sell them GDM and you sell agent employment.\nScott Martinis: Who knows, right?\nScott Martinis: But that's like Future State.\nScott Martinis: The first thing, the thing with agencies is a lot of times they have serious, they have a lot of problems outside of sales and marketing that you can't always solve for them.\nyusheng kuo: Right, right.\nScott Martinis: We solve for them.\nyusheng kuo: So you don't think that by giving them more tools for giving them the direct way to, for example, they now.\nyusheng kuo: Try to sell like a clay table.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nScott Martinis: Tools aren't problems.\nScott Martinis: Tools aren't the problem, man.\nScott Martinis: Clay tables, their own are relatively useless.\nScott Martinis: Yeah, what you need to do is you need clay to scale the way an enterprise account executive thinks about target accounts.\nyusheng kuo: So who do you think is the.\nyusheng kuo: Right customer for us?\nScott Martinis: Agencies are great.\nScott Martinis: Dude.\nScott Martinis: Agencies are freaking great.\nScott Martinis: Love that for you.\nScott Martinis: The.\nScott Martinis: The thing is.\nScott Martinis: So you're right about agencies.\nScott Martinis: It's just for.\nScott Martinis: I'm just saying, for me.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nScott Martinis: I don't see us as competitors.\nScott Martinis: Right.\nScott Martinis: I'm not as technical as you, and you don't know sales and marketing.\nScott Martinis: So if I were you, like, first thing, like.\nScott Martinis: Well, first thing I do is I want to see your offer, and I want to see what you can do and what you can't do, and I want to get some.\nScott Martinis: Some sense of this.\nScott Martinis: And then the next thing, basically, I'm offering you free GDM consulting if you will give me.\nScott Martinis: Free.\nScott Martinis: Free agent engineering coaching.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, that.\nyusheng kuo: That.\nyusheng kuo: That makes perfect sense.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so, like, we have two more minutes.\nyusheng kuo: What do you want, like, from your agent architecture?\nyusheng kuo: Like, what do you think is missing?\nyusheng kuo: And like, say, like, what do you think is not there for you yet?\nScott Martinis: Yeah, so here's the thing that I'm looking for.\nScott Martinis: I want.\nScott Martinis: I want Archie.\nScott Martinis: So.\nScott Martinis: So there's a number of jobs to be done.\nScott Martinis: Can I.\nScott Martinis: You know what?\nScott Martinis: Can we connect on Slack and I'll just send you a voice note?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, that works too.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I got.\nScott Martinis: I gotta jump in a minute as well.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, send me the voicemail.\nyusheng kuo: Tell me what you want from Archie.\nyusheng kuo: And I can tell you what I feel can achieve that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Cool.\nyusheng kuo: And.\nScott Martinis: And if you have questions for.\nScott Martinis: If you have questions, I can relay a question to Archie for you, and then he can answer questions about his database.\nScott Martinis: I gotta jump.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: See you.\nyusheng kuo: Bye.\nTitle: Yusheng Kuo and Scott Martinis\nHost Email:
