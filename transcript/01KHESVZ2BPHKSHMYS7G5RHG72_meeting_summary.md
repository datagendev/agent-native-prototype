## Prospect Meeting: Scott Martinis - B2B Catalyst
**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Participant:** Scott Martinis, GTM/Sales Strategy Consultant, B2B Catalyst (scott@b2bcatalyst.com)
**Duration:** 30.67 minutes
**Meeting Type:** Discovery / Partnership Discussion

### Prospect Profile
- **Company:** B2B Catalyst
- **Role:** GTM/Sales Strategy Consultant specializing in agencies
- **Industry:** B2B SaaS consulting, agency coaching
- **Background:** 8 years in agency space, worked with agency coaching programs, expertise in sales/marketing for agencies

### Pain Points

#### Pain Point 1: Agent Architecture Technical Complexity
- **Depth:** qualified
- **Surface symptom:** "I need help on my agent architecture. I'm not a developer by nature."
- **Business impact:** "There's little things that I'm trying to ship that take some more brain work for me. I can't get cloud teams working. I'm trying to get the Slack integration to work. I want to improve the memory architecture and I need to know when to move into multi agent."
- **DataGen relevance:** Scott is building Claude Code agents but lacks technical expertise to solve infrastructure problems (Slack integration, memory architecture, multi-agent coordination, Claude Teams setup).

#### Pain Point 2: Agent Output Verification Without Domain Expertise
- **Depth:** surface
- **Surface symptom:** "I try to create a contract for one of my clients. I can use cloud code to create a contract, but I have no way to verify the output whether it's legally binded or what."
- **Business impact:** Cannot trust Claude Code outputs in domains outside personal expertise (legal, sales frameworks, marketing).
- **Personal stake:** "If it's coding related capability, I can verify it, but it's like legal if it's a sales. If it's a marketing, I want to delegate to the expert agent that I can actually access his service."
- **DataGen relevance:** Highlights need for agent-to-agent communication for specialized verification/expert services.

#### Pain Point 3: Managing Multiple Agent Specializations at Scale
- **Depth:** surface
- **Surface symptom:** "How do I manage the... Even I have the agent factory. Most of them will probably be mediocre, right? Because I wouldn't have so much time to fine tune each of them."
- **Business impact:** Creating many agents leads to quality degradation because of time constraints to tune each one properly.
- **DataGen relevance:** Need for accessing specialized external agents rather than building/maintaining everything internally.

### Latent Demand Signals

#### Signal 1: Context/Memory Management Challenges
- **Type:** casual-complaint
- **Evidence:** "I got Claude to do a lot of context logging or not a context logging. I got it to write and save session transcripts really quickly. I got a bunch of hooks around pre compaction working."
- **Inferred need:** Building custom workarounds for session management, memory persistence, and context handling suggests infrastructure gaps in current Claude Code setup. DataGen's infrastructure layer could eliminate this custom work.

#### Signal 2: Agent Deployment and Operational Infrastructure Gap
- **Type:** curiosity-question
- **Evidence:** "I basically want a developer that I can bounce off ideas off of. The thing is a lot of how you're positioning this..."
- **Inferred need:** Scott is wrestling with agent deployment, operational patterns, and architecture decisions without technical resources. Shows need for expert consultation or managed infrastructure.

### Current Stack & Workflow

**Tools:**
- Claude Code: Primary agent development environment
- Slack: Attempting integration (currently blocked)
- Claude Teams: Attempting to set up (currently blocked)
- Voice notes: For async communication and transcription

**Manual Processes:**
- Writing custom context logging/session transcript systems
- Building pre-compaction hooks manually
- Troubleshooting Slack integration issues
- Architecting memory systems from scratch

**Integration Gaps:**
- No working Slack integration for agent communication
- No Claude Teams collaboration setup
- Manual session/context management instead of automated infrastructure

**Volume:** Building "Archie" (personal Claude agent) with persistent memory and database, serving as GTM consultant for multiple B2B clients and agency coaching programs.

### Buying Signals
- **Timeline:** Active development mode - needs technical help now for current agent projects
- **Budget:** No explicit budget discussion, but offering value exchange (GTM consulting for technical help)
- **Decision process:** Single decision maker, can move quickly
- **Champion potential:** High - Deep agency network, coaches agency programs, could refer DataGen to entire ecosystem of agencies looking to deploy agents

### Strategic Context: Scott's Business Model
Scott consults on GTM/sales strategy for B2B companies, particularly agencies. He specializes in:
- Reworking sales processes from call analysis (e.g., "reworked someone's entire top of funnel from 90 cold call conversations and 15 sales calls")
- Creating sales collateral (first call decks, follow-up decks, business case materials)
- Understanding agency business models, positioning, and offer packaging
- Fast pattern recognition in sales/marketing materials

**Potential value to DataGen:** Could help refine DataGen's positioning, offer packaging, and sales approach to agencies. Has direct network of agency coaching programs and Facebook groups.

### Proposed Exchange/Partnership
Scott proposed **skill trade arrangement:**
- **Scott provides:** GTM/sales consulting - reviewing sales calls, proposal docs, web pages, offer positioning, agency customer development advice
- **Scott needs:** Technical agent architecture guidance - async Slack support for infrastructure issues, multi-agent patterns, memory architecture, integration troubleshooting

**Proposed cadence:** 30-60 min weekly calls + async Slack support

**Deliverables Scott would provide:**
- Review of DataGen's current offer using "$100 Million Offers" framework
- Critique of sales/marketing materials
- Guidance on agency customer development
- Fast pattern recognition from transcripts/proposals

### Summary
Scott Martinis is a GTM consultant building Claude Code agents but hitting technical infrastructure limits. His primary qualified pain is needing technical architecture guidance for agent deployment, integrations, and memory systems. He shows latent demand for managed agent infrastructure through his manual workarounds. Sees huge opportunity in agent-as-service model but wrestling with technical implementation. Strong champion potential given his agency network and coaching relationships. Proposed value trade: GTM consulting for technical agent architecture support.
