18:52)\nConcluded with appreciation of feedback and scheduling follow-up meeting acknowledging different time zones and late hour.\n, Notes: ## **Tool Call Capacity and Async Workarounds**\n\nThe team is actively addressing the current **limit of 60 tool calls per minute**, aiming to support **up to 300 tool calls per minute** through a code refactor to meet client demand (01:16).  \n- Yusheng explained the ongoing refactor to scale the tool call rate to **300 RPM** to serve clients needing higher throughput.  \n- An async workaround was suggested where clients can initiate a tool run and retrieve the result later, avoiding synchronous wait times for longer-running tools.  \n- This approach helps manage load and improves responsiveness for custom tool executions.  \n- The scaling effort is critical to support complex workflows and larger client requirements.\n\n## **Agent Connection and User Experience Improvements**\n\nUsers experienced issues with repository connection refresh and agent visibility, which have been identified as bugs needing fixes (03:02).  \n- Andriy demonstrated connection problems where repositories did not refresh properly after disconnecting and reconnecting.  \n- Yusheng acknowledged this as a known bug and noted the need for a UI refresh fix to improve user experience.  \n- The disconnect and reconnect sequence was clarified to users as a temporary workaround.  \n- Fixing this will reduce user confusion and improve workflow reliability.\n\n## **CLI Tool Deployment and Management Enhancements**\n\nThe introduction of a **CLI tool** will streamline agent deployment, management, and testing outside the UI, vastly improving developer experience (11:51).  \n- Yusheng described the CLI as a future release that will allow users to deploy, run, and update agents fully from the command line.  \n- This tool avoids manual UI updates and supports syncing local development directly to cloud environments.  \n- The CLI will include authentication and secret management, allowing users to manage tokens and keys within deployment environments.  \n- Expected deployment of this CLI is imminent, with testing planned to enable users to work more efficiently and reduce UI dependency.\n\n## **Agent Testing and Payload Handling**\n\nUsers can now test agents by running payloads directly in the environment, enabling quick validation of agent behavior before deployment (12:59).  \n- Yusheng demonstrated the \u201crun now\u201d feature that accepts JSON payloads for real-time testing of agent responses.  \n- This allows developers to verify agent logic and outputs without full deployment.  \n- Andriy noted this offers more control and cost efficiency compared to third-party solutions, highlighting the value of in-house tools.  \n- The testing feature supports iterative development and reduces deployment errors.\n\n## **Security and API Key Integration**\n\nThe system supports integrating user API keys securely via secret management, enabling controlled access to external services within agents (06:00).  \n- Yusheng walked through setting up API keys by copying token names and pasting secret values into deployment environments.  \n- This method uses environment variables to store sensitive credentials safely, avoiding hardcoding within agents.  \n- The approach supports scalable and secure multi-environment deployments.  \n- It also allows agents to operate under user subscriptions, reducing costs compared to using static API keys.\n\n## **Strategic Focus on Cost Efficiency and Scaling**\n\nThe team emphasized cost savings and scaling as key strategic priorities to differentiate their solution from competitors like Clay (14:10).  \n- Andriy highlighted the solution\u2019s lower cost and full control over agent behavior compared to Clay\u2019s pricing and features.  \n- Yusheng confirmed ongoing efforts to address scaling issues to maintain performance at higher concurrency levels.  \n- These improvements aim to position the product as a cost-effective, scalable platform for complex agent workflows.  \n- Maintaining free usage for early clients was noted as a strategic move to build adoption and gather feedback., Overview: - **Tool Call Capacity:** Refactor intended to increase tool call limit from 60 to 300 per minute for better client support.\n\n- **Agent Connection Issues:** Bugs identified in repository connection refresh, needing fixes to enhance user experience and workflow reliability.\n\n- **CLI Tool Benefits:** Upcoming CLI tool will streamline agent deployment and management, reducing reliance on the UI significantly.\n\n- **Agent Testing Feature:** New \u201crun now\u201d feature allows real-time testing of agents with JSON payloads, improving iteration and error reduction. \n\n- **Secure API Key Integration:** Users can securely integrate API keys via secret management, enhancing deployment security and cost efficiency.\n\n- **Strategic Cost Focus:** Emphasis on cost efficiency and scalability aims to differentiate the solution from competitors and support client adoption., Bullet Gist: \ud83d\ude80 Tool Call Capacity: Refactor intended to increase tool call limit from 60 to 300 per minute for better client support.\n\ud83d\udc1e Agent Connection Issues: Bugs identified in repository connection refresh, needing fixes to enhance user experience and workflow reliability.\n\ud83d\udd27 CLI Tool Benefits: Upcoming CLI tool will streamline agent deployment and management, reducing reliance on the UI significantly.\n\u2705 Agent Testing Feature: New \u201crun now\u201d feature allows real-time testing of agents with JSON payloads, improving iteration and error reduction.\n\ud83d\udd10 Secure API Key Integration: Users can securely integrate API keys via secret management, enhancing deployment security and cost efficiency.\n\ud83d\udcb0 Strategic Cost Focus: Emphasis on cost efficiency and scalability aims to differentiate the solution from competitors and support client adoption., Gist: The meeting focused on addressing tool call capacity, user experience improvements, and upcoming CLI tool deployment to enhance client support and efficiency., Short Summary: The meeting covered several key topics, including the efforts to increase tool call capacity from 60 to 300 calls per minute through a code refactor to better meet client needs. Challenges regarding repository connection refresh and agent visibility were identified as bugs, highlighting the need for UI updates to enhance user experience. Additionally, a CLI tool is set to be deployed, streamlining agent management outside the UI, and improving the developer experience by allowing full command line functionality. A new 'run now' feature for real-time agent testing using JSON payloads was also discussed, facilitating quick validation before deployment. Finally, secure integration of API keys through secret management was emphasized, promoting cost efficiency and secure deployments, with a focus on differentiating from competitors., Transcript Chapters: No transcript chapters"
