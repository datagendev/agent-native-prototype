**Duration:** 106 minutes

### Prospect Profile
- **Company:** Independent consultant/entrepreneur in B2B data space
- **Role:** Building LinkedIn data waterfall API, exploring agent-native sales tools
- **Industry:** B2B data scraping, LinkedIn data providers, outbound sales automation

### Pain Points

#### Pain Point 1: Multi-Channel Coordination Problem
**Description:** Coordinating outbound efforts across multiple channels (LinkedIn, email, calls) is extremely challenging. Actions taken on one platform aren't visible to others, causing duplicated or inconsistent messaging.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "One thing that is always hard for them to check is okay if he actually responding to the email. And then LinkedIn doesn't see that. And your LinkedIn haters will continue to like ask again even they have the email."

#### Pain Point 2: Clay Lacks API Access
**Description:** Clay doesn't provide proper API access, forcing users to rely on UI-based workflows or hack together unsupported client-side API calls, making it nearly impossible for agents to consume.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "It's everything really. You just. They don't even have API... It's fully UI based."

**Additional evidence:**
> "People actually go to the like, like a Clay table website and go to Inspect Inspect website. Like get the, the, the... The cookie and then use like very shady way to access the API like from the client side."

#### Pain Point 3: Clay's Poor Data Quality
**Description:** Despite being positioned as a premium data provider, Clay's unique data offerings (particularly company list building) have poor quality.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "So I think the unique data they have is they have this kind of free company like, like... Like a list building. Right. But even that like data is pretty poor."

#### Pain Point 4: Clay's Difficult User Experience
**Description:** Clay is too complex for non-technical sales reps but targets users who aren't technical enough, creating an awkward middle ground that's being disrupted by AI coding tools.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "They are too hard for salesman and then they are making like the middle layer. Like a middle range of people who originally couldn't code properly... But now like a file code is like... And just replace this layer."

#### Pain Point 5: Friction in Using Clay with Agents
**Description:** Clay's UI-first approach makes everything difficult for agents to consume due to lack of proper integration points and API access.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "These things care more about this like UI list for user. But it's like making everything so hard for agent."

#### Pain Point 6: Setting Up Email Sequences is Painful
**Description:** The current process of setting up email sequences and outbound campaigns is cumbersome and time-consuming.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "I think even that feature was so useful for people who do it now about. Because like nowadays setting up Those sequencing is like pain every day."

#### Pain Point 7: Difficulty Updating Context Manually
**Description:** It's very hard for human beings to manually update and maintain current context and information about accounts and prospects in CRM systems.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "And then like it's always very hard for like a human being coming into here to update."

#### Pain Point 8: Hard to Move Existing Customers to New Solutions
**Description:** When prospects already work with a competitor, it's difficult to get them to switch due to existing relationships and switching costs.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "Like the healthiness like how like for example if they already work with a competitor right. Then yes product speed would be low because like they already have a. It's hard for them to move"

#### Pain Point 9: Security Mistakes as Non-Engineer
**Description:** Non-engineers make beginner security mistakes like exposing API keys in GitHub because they don't fully understand the technical implications of modern development workflows.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "You know, in the beginning I was all the API keys and GitHub or whatever... I did all these beginner mistakes until. Because if you're not an engineer you don't fully understand how suddenly everything moves to GitHub and you don't really know what happened."

#### Pain Point 10: Difficulty in Testing and Verification
**Description:** It's challenging to verify and test scrapers/data providers to determine if they're doing actual scraping versus reselling data.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "It's, it's sometimes hard to do. At least I'm testing them. I'm, you know, I'm, it's not always clear."

#### Pain Point 11: Unresolved Prompt Injection Security Problem
**Description:** The security challenge of prompt injection attacks remains unsolved, which is a fundamental problem for giving agents broad access to systems.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "Like, like, I mean that's unresolved this problem. Right."

#### Pain Point 12: The Impossibility of Future Planning
**Description:** The challenge of understanding how major societal and business changes from AI will unfold, and whether there will even be viable business models in an agent-driven world.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "You know and I think it's the hard thing is what you even said years ago. You know I think there might be a world where everyone has an agent and it's free and to compute will go down by 1000x and. And it's a bit like the Internet but there is no business case for directly. You see what I mean?"

#### Pain Point 13: Everything is Hard to Set Up Currently
**Description:** Making all the various integrations and setups work together in the current tooling landscape is very difficult and time-consuming.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "It's like, how can you make everything so easy nowadays? Very hard."

#### Pain Point 14: Need for Breaks from AI Work - Burnout Risk
**Description:** Deep immersion in AI technology work leads to feeling overwhelmed and addicted, recognizing the need to take breaks to avoid burnout.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "I need a break from the AI stuff, you know. I mean... I'm so addicted to you. I'm completely. It's just crazy."

### Summary

Michael Riedler is a sophisticated operator in the B2B data and outbound sales space who is acutely aware that current tools (especially Clay) are becoming obsolete in an agent-driven world. His main challenges center around: (1) Clay's lack of API access and poor agent-friendliness despite being the market leader, (2) the difficulty of coordinating multi-channel outbound efforts without agents, and (3) the fundamental uncertainty about building sustainable businesses as AI transforms the entire sales landscape. He sees traditional sales tools as creating friction for automation while failing to serve either technical or non-technical users effectively.
