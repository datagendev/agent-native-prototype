everything?\nyusheng kuo: Hey.\nyusheng kuo: Good.\nDavid Kwint: Sorry about the delay, man.\nDavid Kwint: No, yeah, Stuck in the car.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, no worries.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's always nice in a call.\nyusheng kuo: Like, even pipeline, it's moving.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: How are you doing?\nyusheng kuo: Well, yeah, quite busy.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, we.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, we did a bunch of things.\nyusheng kuo: Think of a bunch of things.\nyusheng kuo: It's just fun.\nyusheng kuo: Like, and then.\nyusheng kuo: And I think especially for our agent deployment, people are quite interesting.\nyusheng kuo: Like, they want to, like, have a way to, like, automatically update everything, not just like manually.\nyusheng kuo: And I mean, that's what cloud code currently are missing.\nyusheng kuo: Now, I don't know if they will have that, like, soon, but now there's no way for, like, making your cloud code similarly, like, integrated into your system.\nyusheng kuo: And like, yeah, couldn't be, like, nowadays I can capture this meeting.\nyusheng kuo: My Firefly would just fire like a web code to my deploy agent and it was summarized based on my guidance in the cloud imd.\nyusheng kuo: And then I summarize it and it sent to the right person.\nyusheng kuo: And I don't know if I told you that we have this feature called email notification.\nyusheng kuo: So after the agent finished the email summary, right.\nyusheng kuo: He will send you a email and then you can actually reply to the email.\nyusheng kuo: Like, hey, I got like yesterday we have an internal meeting, right?\nyusheng kuo: And then unlike the Fireflies, I can just set up whatever type of a classification I want.\nyusheng kuo: So it's an internal meeting.\nyusheng kuo: So they have a to do list.\nyusheng kuo: And I can just say, okay, what are the five to do lists?\nyusheng kuo: That's important, like through our meeting.\nyusheng kuo: And it would just respond, yeah, And I have like, first of all, I have a dashboard, like every morning talking about product and if I see anything I can access, I think, why, like, you can get, you know, like most of the dashboard, like a report, you get like a static, right?\nyusheng kuo: You couldn't like, ask for it.\nyusheng kuo: If you want to ask for it, you have to go to, like, the app or whatever to begin.\nyusheng kuo: And then now I can just like, email back.\nyusheng kuo: It does feel almost like an employee, like, kind of working for you, that type of sense.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But there are a lot of things we want to add.\nyusheng kuo: Like, can I just like tag any agent I have?\nyusheng kuo: Say, like yesterday I wanted, okay, here's the Fire aping and I want to say, CC another agent.\nyusheng kuo: Say, hey, a developer agent.\nyusheng kuo: Take all this five feature we need to implement.\nyusheng kuo: Go implement, Create a PR and let me review.\nyusheng kuo: There are so many loops that we need to close, but I think that what open clause showed us is if you have this kind of proactive agent, I mean every morning everything happens.\nyusheng kuo: I don't need to go into manually trigger every meeting.\nyusheng kuo: It will send me something and I can just smoothly doing things.\nyusheng kuo: It's quite interesting honestly.\nyusheng kuo: There's another example I had.\nyusheng kuo: Typically I want to know how user was doing but I always not able to constantly discipline to check the the user's behavior.\nyusheng kuo: So I set up this agent like give me like every day like two, two days, two times a day and then it show up and I know there's a user actually is using because I was Gmail have the issue.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: I see a user trying to activate that and before I wouldn't be able to see it unless I go in.\nyusheng kuo: And also because I create an email that actually I can just one click because email have HTML like buil in right.\nyusheng kuo: So I can just one click that email button and then you actually already created that like a title like who I should send to and I just need to like type the email and then like in two, two seconds I just like saying like oh sorry like I think you are using something wrong but let me know.\nyusheng kuo: You know it's just like yeah, it's like.\nyusheng kuo: It's a lot of like thing I think to me is like it greatly improve my observability for everything.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And I don't need to like keep track of it.\nyusheng kuo: I do want to try the open claw.\nyusheng kuo: I haven't had a chance.\nyusheng kuo: It's kind of pain neck to set up.\nDavid Kwint: It's also pretty unsecure I think.\nDavid Kwint: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So it's like I think, I think if you give it the right access but you just need to configure a lot of things, make it work reliably.\nyusheng kuo: That's the thing.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So currently we are just using our own agent for everything because we also have this kind of crown job to do things.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So but yeah, that's just what we are kind of recently doing.\nyusheng kuo: And another thing, the reason I tried to make this call is like I should see how you got to talk to many cloud users.\nyusheng kuo: There's always a flow.\nyusheng kuo: It's like okay, they now see how easy to develop a strategy come up with what API they should call end to end in cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: But they still in terms of deployment implementation, they still need to go to clay.\nyusheng kuo: And then I don't know if you know Andre, he said he kind of developed something in Calco super fast because Calco can quickly pull everything together.\nyusheng kuo: But then he needs to create like nine different table in Clay because like clay is like very Strict like one by one.\nyusheng kuo: One by one.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So let me quickly show you what I, what I'm thinking and maybe get some of your advice.\nyusheng kuo: Let me see if you can see my screen.\nyusheng kuo: Yep.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So what I think is like you know, clay is pretty good at paralyzed like rounding machine.\nyusheng kuo: Like, like a trigger that clay, right.\nyusheng kuo: It's a, it's very reliable.\nyusheng kuo: Well not super reliable, but it can handle it already can have all the queuing like event driven type of thing to run parallel quite well.\nyusheng kuo: But it's very hard to like use whatever in the middle, right.\nyusheng kuo: Like in which call this API, do the same, do this data transformation.\nyusheng kuo: Cloud code is really good at that.\nyusheng kuo: But it needs some kind of running machine to run your cloud code instance.\nyusheng kuo: So what I'm thinking is first your client have some kind of input, right.\nyusheng kuo: And then you can send it through the webhook or like a HTTP and then we can first simulate that or doing that kind of development company content.\nyusheng kuo: And then I just ask CC to do all the enrichment.\nyusheng kuo: I will give you all the tool to enrich so you can finally have a structured output, a signal on the signal two, whatever.\nyusheng kuo: So we develop that here like for one company and just like deploy that.\nyusheng kuo: Then whatever you can develop will immediately be available in Clay.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So, so you kind of abstract all this complexity into like cloud code agent.\nyusheng kuo: So your client actually just call this agent and this agent will eventually like send the data back to client for the rest of the thing.\nyusheng kuo: Like if you want to do instantly integration, for example.\nyusheng kuo: So like I don't know, it's like this would help like don't repeat yourself.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Whatever you develop in Karl code, you can immediately actually use that in your clay.\nyusheng kuo: That, that's like the high level idea.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, yeah, no, that makes sense.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, I think that would be helpful because that's the thing that I'm struggling with.\nDavid Kwint: Like all the processes that are before creating, before going into Clay, I have already figured out via cloud calls like yeah, yeah.\nDavid Kwint: How the process is looking like what, what APIs to use and so on.\nDavid Kwint: And honestly the most time consuming task is to build it in clay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: So that's, that's a goal of this.\nyusheng kuo: Like yeah, if I can.\nyusheng kuo: Because one thing that's very powerful in cloud code is like if you build it in it, you can like self test it, right.\nyusheng kuo: And you can see the result.\nyusheng kuo: I know people are recently doing this like Jordan, he's like clay, send to cloud code and then send back to Clay.\nyusheng kuo: Let the clay do it again and send Back to cloud code type of thing.\nyusheng kuo: But my thought is like why don't you just abstract away let cloud code figure it out itself.\nyusheng kuo: So your clay just need to kind of come in once so that you go back and using clay gents again.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, because I, I think Calco is very capable asset compared to clay agents.\nyusheng kuo: It's probably more powerful than clay gen. Yeah, that, that's.\nyusheng kuo: That's kind of my thought and I, I can show you what I have now.\nyusheng kuo: I also want to learn how.\nyusheng kuo: How you currently are doing things where you start to.\nyusheng kuo: To like.\nyusheng kuo: Like just.\nyusheng kuo: Just over your workflow.\nyusheng kuo: So because I'm on laptop, let me try to.\nyusheng kuo: That's that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I don't know if you can see my screen.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, I can see the picture.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I try to scroll.\nyusheng kuo: So what it do is it first try to find out all the tool like the API you need it.\nyusheng kuo: So you.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: I want to get linking company data for linking.\nyusheng kuo: I'm using like a head care as example and I get parallel search path to find HR for example and get LinkedIn present data to verify the contact and get LinkedIn personal post to know what this person's recent activity and use biocrawl to scrap the job posting.\nyusheng kuo: A bit of a context.\nyusheng kuo: So cloudcode I was asking okay, how should I prepare this campaign if I'm.\nyusheng kuo: I'm David and well, I'm not an expert but he said okay because HR probably will be the one who is in charge of doing this like a vocal power of we need this EAP thing.\nyusheng kuo: I mean they are doing like a nanny stuff, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's exactly right.\nDavid Kwint: Like the campaign which we're mostly doing is exactly that workflow.\nDavid Kwint: Like enriching the company, enriching the HR leader and then.\nyusheng kuo: Oh really?\nDavid Kwint: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: Finding out about the job postings and analyzing the job.\nDavid Kwint: The job descriptions.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: And scraping basically the German equivalent of Glassdoor.\nyusheng kuo: You know what this is?\nyusheng kuo: He mentioned like because originally he's trying to do Glassdoor, right.\nyusheng kuo: But he said oh there's a different company called like yeah, I didn't know this company.\nyusheng kuo: And then like because he tried to spread like Plastor but nothing found.\nyusheng kuo: He's like oh you should go to Canoodu.\nyusheng kuo: And then this is actually what he found like category like he found like coaching.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know this word but I guess it's Germany for.\nyusheng kuo: But like I don't, I don't even know what the ACH means before until like wait, wait, why does the ach.\nyusheng kuo: And then he could Just like explain to me.\nyusheng kuo: So it's like so powerful.\nyusheng kuo: Like I can do so many things.\nyusheng kuo: Like, like I can ask questions even.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know, I can kind of come up with some, like some, some ideas.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So, so I, I, there's nothing fancy.\nyusheng kuo: I, I basically just like I can actually pull the.\nyusheng kuo: So what it does is so I only scrap like a part of it so early on.\nyusheng kuo: It's like a campaign strategizing, right.\nyusheng kuo: And I say okay, you should assume you are getting some company data.\nyusheng kuo: Like for example, he's mentioned like I said look at the website, look at what's your company.\nyusheng kuo: And then you give me something like a thermography Persona.\nyusheng kuo: And I said okay, assume you can get that in clay, right?\nyusheng kuo: Because clay probably is really good at those I live building.\nyusheng kuo: And then you will get a row from the clay.\nyusheng kuo: And how would you enrich this row like this company?\nyusheng kuo: And then he was like.\nyusheng kuo: And then like.\nyusheng kuo: Because I have a bunch of like four in my mcp so because these are all like in, in my mcp and so he was just like, okay, these are a few like a useful one.\nyusheng kuo: And I really like parallel search.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know if you use them.\nyusheng kuo: I think their result is really good in terms of search.\nyusheng kuo: And then I use Biocro to do real scrapping.\nDavid Kwint: What would you recommend here?\nDavid Kwint: Because what I would want to do right now is basically just use the Konunu Epify scraper.\nDavid Kwint: Do you think would be better?\nyusheng kuo: No, no, I just don't have an amplify like account.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, but, but the Amplify also have the tool and API, right?\nyusheng kuo: I use the tool because I.\nyusheng kuo: It's faster because I everything is already in cloud.\nyusheng kuo: I don't need to like like set up the API key locally everywhere.\nyusheng kuo: But you can totally use API as well.\nDavid Kwint: It is what like you have a bit more experience here.\nDavid Kwint: Do you think like Amplify is better for.\nDavid Kwint: Let's say.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, Konunus or Glass Doors Gray or Fire Crawl.\nyusheng kuo: I think it feels like if it's on demand, scrap firecrow is good enough.\nyusheng kuo: But Applify probably will give you more like large data set.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So if I'm using Amplify I probably would do it more for like large quantities scrapping.\nyusheng kuo: Like I, I wouldn't just scrap like a one because basically what it does is it basically spin up the whole container, right.\nyusheng kuo: And then do.\nyusheng kuo: If you only do like a small.\nyusheng kuo: It's actually quite expensive and quite time consuming.\nyusheng kuo: Like Firecraw on the other hand is like, is already Kind of always, always trying to crawling, scrapping.\nyusheng kuo: It's like a machine is always running.\nyusheng kuo: So unless you are going to scrap like a large amount of data.\nyusheng kuo: I probably would go for Firecross.\nyusheng kuo: It's more lightweight and I don't need to go to like find the right actor doing like one by one.\nyusheng kuo: It's more like on demand.\nyusheng kuo: I. I don't like.\nyusheng kuo: I. I don't know.\nyusheng kuo: I need to scrap in like in the beginning.\nyusheng kuo: So like Firecraw become like more.\nyusheng kuo: More steerable.\nyusheng kuo: You know like I can ask you to go to like website scrap their official.\nyusheng kuo: For example some company have their own like job site.\nyusheng kuo: Not.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so that's where I go.\nyusheng kuo: But.\nyusheng kuo: But I. I think if you know really sure.\nyusheng kuo: Like amplify have good quality of data then you should just go for appify as well.\nyusheng kuo: But, but just like you need to describe that in cloud code like in your preference and then once you describe that actually you can record that right.\nyusheng kuo: Like into your like a to do.\nyusheng kuo: I actually created this to do in my.\nyusheng kuo: I need to pull that because I did that in my company.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I don't have that down to four.\nyusheng kuo: I'm just a.\nyusheng kuo: So he gets to pull like the data but in the meantime I will.\nyusheng kuo: Ah gosh.\nyusheng kuo: That's why my kids at home today.\nyusheng kuo: So I have to go out.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: So and for like for job postings.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: Most of the time I'm just using the job posting enrichment by Clay that pulls all the jobs from LinkedIn which is basically for free.\nDavid Kwint: But oftentimes.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: Like you said companies have their own job portal or they have jobs on their website.\nDavid Kwint: Then you would suggest using Firecraw for that.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Unless.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I mean I. I have to be honest, I'm not an expert like scrapper so I'm more like.\nyusheng kuo: I think my expertise is more like the system level, not on the like individual cool level.\nyusheng kuo: But from my experience Firecore is getting really good recently.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, early day was bad but nowadays it's really reliable.\nyusheng kuo: Like he just like for example the one here, he will just be able to like go into Kalunu and scrap and handling the bot detection and then get back me this result before I. I don't know if I can.\nyusheng kuo: I can get it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah but.\nyusheng kuo: But the thing I.\nyusheng kuo: Let me first try to pull the.\nyusheng kuo: Where we are.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: So.\nyusheng kuo: So what it does is it will try to do this kind of step by step.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like I was doing like a team viewer.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know why you choose team viewer, but whatever.\nyusheng kuo: Like he would try to Say first I need step one.\nyusheng kuo: I get teamviewers linking company data.\nyusheng kuo: So you use the tool like in Data Gen to get the data of where they are and then find the HR leader using parallel search.\nyusheng kuo: And he found him and get his full link in to confirm.\nyusheng kuo: Yes, he is like started at January 2025.\nyusheng kuo: These are all kind of done by Clauco.\nyusheng kuo: I didn't intervene that I kind of say hey, you should just do this step and say okay, Steph was down and then he pulled his post.\nyusheng kuo: Try to learn his interest through his post and then be like I bet he's writing Germany.\nyusheng kuo: But it's like a translated for me English already and like and he tried to first try to scrap like John Poston using glassword but he said like glass or benefit that you found.\nyusheng kuo: Not scrap, no benefits E word.\nyusheng kuo: So it's PI.\nyusheng kuo: Oh you should go to Kanunu and then the community page found you already show benefit and I ask you to scrap it.\nyusheng kuo: And here's like the team keyword and I say okay, I love it.\nyusheng kuo: Let me have it into save that use case in play.\nyusheng kuo: Hey, care with how to use tool.\nyusheng kuo: So you kind of know how to use the tool, right?\nyusheng kuo: From our like development.\nyusheng kuo: So that's how I call like a development.\nyusheng kuo: It's like I try to tell it, okay, this is not right that you, you are not getting the right result.\nyusheng kuo: And I don't know if you notice like in the middle I actually I ask it.\nyusheng kuo: Or maybe I didn't.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, you just kind of figure out I didn't even try to intervene.\nyusheng kuo: So I say okay, like save everything to like save them to attempt to read also another TeamView progress MD to show where I am.\nyusheng kuo: So like even in the middle of that I know where I can continue to do it.\nyusheng kuo: And the point is like okay, once I develop like one of this and then it has like a real data for this teamviewer company, right.\nyusheng kuo: I can actually turn this whole thing into the Agent and then just deploy to Clay.\nyusheng kuo: So first I deploy this cloud called agent, right?\nyusheng kuo: And then Clay will just directly call this agent and then do the whole enrichment.\nyusheng kuo: So I don't need to like I'm not sure how easy like to try to do everything in Clay.\nyusheng kuo: I probably need to figure out how each UI component in Clay to redo it again.\nyusheng kuo: Like also something I want to do is like I want to scrape how many posts like job posts that have recently compared to last month.\nyusheng kuo: So I know if they are actually trying to like increasing their hiring chain or they are Slowing down.\nyusheng kuo: And I can easily like do everything in here and then make it like step by step.\nyusheng kuo: But the point is I want the.\nyusheng kuo: Let me see.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So he's trying to clone.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know if you download the GitHub CLI because once you do, user actually can do every GitHub action here, like in cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So let me actually exit out and enter into this.\nyusheng kuo: It's easier for you to see.\nyusheng kuo: It.\nyusheng kuo: So I say, what's the plan?\nyusheng kuo: So you probably would describe it better than me.\nyusheng kuo: Oh yeah, that's.\nyusheng kuo: That's kind of the idea that I have.\nyusheng kuo: Like, how do I easily develop everything in cloud code while leveraging Clay's like capability to run everything in parallel?\nyusheng kuo: Massively.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: And on scale, basically.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: The thing that I.\nDavid Kwint: That's basically the biggest.\nDavid Kwint: Like using cloud code just for everything before Clay is already a huge unlock and like automating all that stuff.\nDavid Kwint: But actually if you can automate the actual Clay table creation and running on scale, then that's.\nDavid Kwint: That would be insane.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So here's the idea.\nyusheng kuo: Like you have a play table, right.\nyusheng kuo: You have a prospect list and you use web with trigger.\nyusheng kuo: You kind of know my goal is like using the idea agent, but it's actually a cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: Why is so good nowadays?\nyusheng kuo: Actually there's a cloud under the hood to execute the enrichment pipeline.\nyusheng kuo: Like get linking company data, MCP parallel search, get linking person data and return to Clay with the score signals, email copy.\nyusheng kuo: What I want is actually have every.\nyusheng kuo: So here's output is a structured data.\nyusheng kuo: But I want the next step is like.\nyusheng kuo: I want every middle step here to also be part of the JSON file return.\nyusheng kuo: So I can like audit everything.\nyusheng kuo: Not just like the final result.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nDavid Kwint: And also like a reasoning for like reasoning for qualification kind of stuff.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: I can add.\nyusheng kuo: And then you will just force it to.\nyusheng kuo: To fill out this.\nyusheng kuo: I say, okay, you need to prepare all of this before you can fill out.\nyusheng kuo: If you don't have anything, you should like an error out.\nyusheng kuo: You should just have an error like here.\nyusheng kuo: So I know it's error.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So that's the idea.\nyusheng kuo: Like.\nyusheng kuo: And then I.\nyusheng kuo: This is like a one company, right?\nyusheng kuo: Like one row.\nyusheng kuo: So I can focus it on like doing like one use case and then test that.\nyusheng kuo: And it wasn't the use case.\nyusheng kuo: Like Team Viewer.\nyusheng kuo: Team Viewer is working.\nyusheng kuo: I can just deploy the whole agent to Clay and I would do for TeamViewer, do for SAP, do for like all different bsch.\nyusheng kuo: Like company list that Clay is doing.\nyusheng kuo: And then Clay will tell me to handle the queuing.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: He wouldn't just like all of a sudden like blast my API.\nyusheng kuo: He would like to take it like one by one.\nyusheng kuo: But I don't need to build that in Clay.\nyusheng kuo: So that's like.\nyusheng kuo: And I can even like after this result.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: I can do the next thing.\nyusheng kuo: Like for example, like integration to Slack, integration to instantly and using the email body or like email subject from like Cloudflare.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, that's.\nyusheng kuo: That's the idea.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know like how does that actually.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: What's.\nyusheng kuo: What's your workflow that I. I kind of introduced mine.\nyusheng kuo: And what do you think will be.\nyusheng kuo: What's the current workflow for example?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know if you can show me or.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nDavid Kwint: So basically first I go into cloud code 3D for everything really.\nDavid Kwint: For every starting company.\nyusheng kuo: And can I. Oh yeah, yeah.\nDavid Kwint: And so I have basically this agent.\nDavid Kwint: Client onboarding orchestrator.\nyusheng kuo: Oh cool.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nDavid Kwint: Which basically once I have because like the first.\nDavid Kwint: The very, very first step every client has to go through is fill out the onboarding form.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: And my online way it looks like.\nyusheng kuo: Like the typical onboarding one.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: So it's a lot of questions basically.\nDavid Kwint: But it talks about like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, how.\nDavid Kwint: Is your icp, what problem does your product solve?\nDavid Kwint: Competitors, whatever.\nDavid Kwint: Like I try to get almost all complete context.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: From this.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: And then I go into.\nDavid Kwint: Basically once this is in here, I go into club calls.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: And use the agent to then based on the.\nDavid Kwint: So it takes that into account and then also does a deep research on the company and then.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: Like it does a 10 mapping, it does ICP, it does playbooks and like then you see for every company here, like different ICP segments, you just do the agent.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Hey, can I. Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: This is your.\nyusheng kuo: But you know if you deploy this agent to Datagen and like fill out have the web host trigger.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So like every time they fill out they not just sent to your Slack, they will also send to the agent of this one and directly building it for you.\nyusheng kuo: It just be a super good use case for us.\nyusheng kuo: You don't need to pay for anything.\nyusheng kuo: Can you give me like a short version?\nyusheng kuo: Doesn't really reveal your.\nyusheng kuo: Because this is so cool.\nyusheng kuo: Then every time a company show up, you already have the contacts ready to build in.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, no, that's definitely an agent that I want to build in Datagen and Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But okay, let's like it's just very interesting.\nyusheng kuo: Like yeah, you can you can go on.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nDavid Kwint: And basically.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, it's deep research, competitive landscape, GTM strategy, icp.\nDavid Kwint: And I also have the onboarding form here still.\nDavid Kwint: Pain signals.\nDavid Kwint: And the Playbook is really the main thing because the Playbook basically tells me the messaging based on a.\nDavid Kwint: Based on the framework that I really like for copy and based on the messaging angles.\nDavid Kwint: It also tells me what kind of data I need, like job descriptions, whatever.\nDavid Kwint: And based on that, I can build that in clay then.\nDavid Kwint: And I see that's the part that I automated with cloud code now and really everything else.\nDavid Kwint: Like, if I can connect all of that information or this agent to the agent that you just presented.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, I can basically just like the agent then has all the context about this company.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: And can build all the K tables.\nDavid Kwint: It's a.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, because you.\nyusheng kuo: You already have all the context here.\nyusheng kuo: It's much richer than, like, clay, but in clay now you have to kind of manually go.\nyusheng kuo: Like, even you use sculpture, it's still hard to give it all the context here.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Because I.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, then I basically.\nDavid Kwint: And I haven't built this.\nDavid Kwint: It's just a T mapping that I did from AI arc, which is just a database, but I have the basic chromographics here, like company location, company size, business.\nyusheng kuo: Where do you get this data?\nDavid Kwint: AI arc.\nyusheng kuo: It's a.\nyusheng kuo: It's a company or.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, it's like Apollo here.\nyusheng kuo: Oh.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, I saw people.\nyusheng kuo: You mentioned that.\nyusheng kuo: How does this work?\nDavid Kwint: It's like Apollo, but way better because they scrape in real time from.\nDavid Kwint: From LinkedIn.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, okay.\nyusheng kuo: Well, and then you map.\nyusheng kuo: Map 10.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, I mapped them basically with the companies and then the persons, and then I sent that into clay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nDavid Kwint: And here I can basically filter out, like, what kind of Kununu score do they have?\nDavid Kwint: How many job openings do they have?\nyusheng kuo: And that kind of.\nDavid Kwint: Wait, how do you.\nyusheng kuo: How do you.\nyusheng kuo: How do you score for Nunu here?\nDavid Kwint: I'm not doing it right now, but what I would do is just.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, I see here.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nDavid Kwint: I would just use an epify, the apify Konuna scraper here and then let AI analyze.\nDavid Kwint: Like, what's in there, how's the score, and so on.\nyusheng kuo: I see.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: And then that's just one.\nyusheng kuo: But you also need to enrich the contact, right?\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, the contacts then are here.\nDavid Kwint: Like, all disqualified.\nDavid Kwint: People I can, like, get rid of.\nyusheng kuo: But also, there's also people level.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, cool.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, this is people level.\nDavid Kwint: And I can.\nDavid Kwint: What I need to do is also, like, normalize first name.\nDavid Kwint: I need to find Out.\nDavid Kwint: Is this actually a relevant title based on their Personas?\nDavid Kwint: I need to find out like, yeah, is this a relevant company?\nDavid Kwint: And so on.\nDavid Kwint: So yeah, then write the messages.\nyusheng kuo: Then what do you think the, like, what do you think the main blocker for you to do in cloudcom but in Clay?\nyusheng kuo: Like why do you, what, what do you think is like try like pull you into clay for this?\nDavid Kwint: I mean I think cloud code is really good for like automating like coming up with a strategy and coming up with like text and so on.\nDavid Kwint: And I mean you could.\nDavid Kwint: I. I'm also a fan like using MCP for certain tasks.\nDavid Kwint: But this is good for maybe 100 companies.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nDavid Kwint: I tried to analyze like close one deals in HubSpot for a company and it only did it.\nDavid Kwint: I told it like it's 150 companies and I told it do it for every company and it's only, it only did it for me like for 50 companies.\nDavid Kwint: And I tried to do more.\nDavid Kwint: Do more but it didn't really do it.\nDavid Kwint: So I feel like it's.\nDavid Kwint: It's not good.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's the point.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's the point.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, like it's not good for.\nDavid Kwint: It's not able to do it for like 20000 companies.\nyusheng kuo: Exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I agree.\nDavid Kwint: So that's why that's where.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's what I. I don't know.\nyusheng kuo: You remember the original architecture I show is like I try to force the agent only look at like one company and then the agent is basically only in reach.\nyusheng kuo: His job is only reaching like one company only.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then, but if you can deploy that to cloud, then we can have Clay to call like 1000 times to the agent.\nDavid Kwint: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So you kind of like balance.\nyusheng kuo: Because I feel Clay is such a good tool for running SQL.\nyusheng kuo: Like you said like a deployment.\nyusheng kuo: And Calco is so good at doing one type of thing, doing one company enrichment.\nyusheng kuo: He can go very deep and very flexible and then he can also output this kind of structure output.\nyusheng kuo: So if we can bring these two together that will be very powerful.\nyusheng kuo: I never think one, two can do everything.\nyusheng kuo: Now people are trying to do Calco for end to end.\nyusheng kuo: I don't think it's there yet.\nyusheng kuo: And even you build the whole Python script in cloud code, right.\nyusheng kuo: There are still a lot of time that the API will time out and then your resource not well balanced and you will find out you'll be just constantly maintaining that.\nyusheng kuo: But if you only give cloud code doing one company and then let Clay to handle all this different, like when should I call?\nyusheng kuo: Like, because Clay will actually time it, right?\nyusheng kuo: It doesn't run like everything in once.\nyusheng kuo: For example, like do this and then queue it and wait for API response to make sure it's like not overwhelming the API call.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I don't know if you're interested.\nyusheng kuo: Let's try to like I can try to create an agent for you and then because it's just an API, right?\nyusheng kuo: You will actually use my.\nyusheng kuo: And then it's a webhook code, so you can call it too.\nyusheng kuo: So actually like webhook should be treated as secret, but I can give it to you and then you can kind of tell me like how did it go?\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And then if we.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know if you want to publish this, if this kind of really working and then become like streamlined like a create like a command.\nyusheng kuo: So every time it will be like you have an agent like onboard the user and then you kind of review the context and then you run this kind of create table for like a one company.\nyusheng kuo: And then if it's good, you say, okay, deploy this agent.\nyusheng kuo: And then you will get the like a webhook and then you just like call it in Clay.\nDavid Kwint: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, sorry, my.\nyusheng kuo: I'm in the coffee shop.\nyusheng kuo: So Internet was not good.\nyusheng kuo: But yeah, that's the idea.\nyusheng kuo: Like so like, so you haven't done the haycare, right?\nyusheng kuo: Like the idea is like, okay, you can do all the enrichment to like cloud code and then you can just like using.\nyusheng kuo: You can also use amplify, whatever, like let cloud code hold the amplify.\nyusheng kuo: And then because it's only like a one company so it doesn't overwhelm the context window and then you can test it like what the structure output look like and then you can kind of fine tune it until it's good.\nyusheng kuo: And I think you already know how to create agent, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know if you want to try to do it in cloud code and then we can try to help you deploy and then let's see how much time actually can be shrink.\nyusheng kuo: So for now, if you want to go to big here, you have to build the table column one by one.\nyusheng kuo: Or you think Sculptor can help you to do that?\nyusheng kuo: That.\nDavid Kwint: I tried Sculptor, but it's not really good to be honest in building things.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nDavid Kwint: Mostly I'm using Sculptor like to analyze or to like get me all columns data into one column.\nDavid Kwint: Okay, I see that's where it's really good.\nDavid Kwint: But creating columns, it just takes some random APIs and then it doesn't really make sense.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: What do you think?\nyusheng kuo: What do you think?\nyusheng kuo: Can we try to test out this methodology?\nyusheng kuo: Like how would that work?\nDavid Kwint: Yeah, I mean we can try to build it out and I can test it out for heycare like for this example, for this enrichment basically that we talked about.\nyusheng kuo: Let's try to start small.\nyusheng kuo: Let's try to start small.\nyusheng kuo: Like let's try to enrich this LinkedIn like the contacts LinkedIn.\nyusheng kuo: So if you can tell me what the incoming data you will try to give me.\nyusheng kuo: Like for example you already have the contact data, right.\nyusheng kuo: And then what would be the output result that you are interested And I can try to create an agent that you can call like directly.\nyusheng kuo: I have the.\nyusheng kuo: The final result would just be a JSON output for all the columns needed.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then you need to give me like what the input data will look like and yeah, and then we can start maybe just a small segment like for example job base like linking, linking post job scrap draw result.\nyusheng kuo: So you don't need to like do it end to end and then like analyze and maybe the post email for example or like this kind of score.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And we can build this like in cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: It takes me like a two minutes to build because you already can know how to search all the tool and then even API is fine.\nyusheng kuo: It just needs to be more nudging to tell him like okay, you should look at this API and probably more testing.\nyusheng kuo: But, but even, even with API I think it was also very quick and then he would just figure out how to pull the workflow together then.\nyusheng kuo: But yes, let's see where it breaks.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And how much actually all I actually provide.\nyusheng kuo: And then could you eventually like end to end creation?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It's like you get the onboarding and then you can push the.\nyusheng kuo: Because you can pull the ARC AI for API and then you can push that to clay and then you have clay template like called the webhook automatically I create an enrichment plan.\nyusheng kuo: So you have an agent called enrichment.\nyusheng kuo: Eventually that agent was just like I'll put that like.\nyusheng kuo: Because I think there's an idea called Surface as a software.\nyusheng kuo: That's why I see recently it's kind of proposed.\nyusheng kuo: Well it was posting a while ago but they are saying like the agency service as a software and this could actually scale this.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like your client can like get.\nyusheng kuo: You can't have like 100 clients at the same time without being super overwhelmed.\nyusheng kuo: If you can set up the automation tool.\nyusheng kuo: Possible.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah and I think the most important thing that you can provide them is one, that's your context repository.\nyusheng kuo: But second is like how fast you can implement, because the faster you can implement them, the more tests they can do.\nyusheng kuo: Like, okay, you tell me one thing.\nyusheng kuo: I will have a campaign tomorrow ready for you then.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I know most of the agency couldn't provide that, like even just a baseline.\nyusheng kuo: So.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, let me.\nyusheng kuo: Give me the possible input that you think will be necessary.\nyusheng kuo: I know you have a lot of column.\nyusheng kuo: Give me the necessary input.\nDavid Kwint: Like on company level, it's just company name and domain.\nDavid Kwint: Really.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Then let's try it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then I would give you an agent and you can try to call it and then see the output of it.\nyusheng kuo: Probably just one and two and.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, and then maybe you can paste me what the output look like, how reliable it is, and then whether the result is clear or not.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I need to hop to another call, but this is like super helpful.\nyusheng kuo: Thank you.\nyusheng kuo: Super cool.\nDavid Kwint: Thanks a lot for Shane.\nDavid Kwint: I think once this is done and maybe if this is working, then that's a huge unlock.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, good to hear.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, thank you.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: All right, bye.\nyusheng kuo: Bye.\nTitle: 30 Min
