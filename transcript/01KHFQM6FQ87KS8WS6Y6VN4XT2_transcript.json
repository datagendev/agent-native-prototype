You probably have checked it or haven't.\nyusheng kuo: It's like an infrastructure layer for cloud code so you can easily deploy your agent to run like 24 7.\nyusheng kuo: So in your example it's like you don't need to go into.\nyusheng kuo: Because one of the important things of a signal is you try it to be almost like a real time.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So it's like if you have to go into cloudcode company name, you probably already missed something.\nyusheng kuo: A benefit of a deploy agent is it just run like a 247 or triggered by any kind of webhook because I don't know if you heard of.\nyusheng kuo: Webhook is basically a way for external systems send the information in and trigger your cloud code to run.\nyusheng kuo: So that's what we are doing.\nyusheng kuo: So basically you can take your example is like whenever there's a new event coming in for a particular client, you will actually depend on the service you've been subscribed to.\nyusheng kuo: But for example, you have an RSS fee for some news, right.\nyusheng kuo: It will send some kind of a news or like oh, they just announced their earnings call event and it will send an event and then they will update your contacts in Calco and let you send you email say okay, they just published their earning and it was some kind of a important thing that you should notice.\nyusheng kuo: So you can like act the first.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so that's, that's where we are.\nyusheng kuo: But for today's scope, I tried to introduce what I feel about agent and how I feel about almost like a future of the software.\nyusheng kuo: Where is there a heading I would try to share my screen first.\nyusheng kuo: Now my.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know why, but my screen constantly like drop off.\nyusheng kuo: So if you, if you see me like get caught up of my screen, just let me know.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah, for sure.\nyusheng kuo: See now?\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah, you can see it's a little bit blurry, but yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, good.\nyusheng kuo: So I don't know if you try to use GitHub but later on I will basically send you everything.\nyusheng kuo: It's just this GitHub how to build agents and you can read it and I have created a skill here that later on you can just try to follow the agent and skill.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So I will first go very high level of what I feel how people like there are now like a two camera people who's using cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: The first camera people, I will describe it on the right side.\nyusheng kuo: So they try to use cloud code to build some software.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So cloud code basically is like coding assistant.\nyusheng kuo: But the result of the product itself has nothing to do with AI or very little to do with AI.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: They build their workflow, they build a clay.\nyusheng kuo: Like there's a lot of people say, oh, I try to replace clay with in Kaukow, he built a workflow.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: But that workflow itself is like no AI inside it.\nyusheng kuo: Or I build a dashboard to monitor our icp, but that dashboard have no AI inside of it.\nyusheng kuo: It's not responsive, it's not adaptive.\nyusheng kuo: So that's like the agent assisted software building.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: You're still building software like in 2010.\nyusheng kuo: It's just the process you build it is different, but the nature of the software is the same.\nyusheng kuo: How do you know is it different?\nyusheng kuo: It's like if the software is like the core compared to the agent is the core.\nyusheng kuo: So there's another kind of people.\nyusheng kuo: The most prominent case nowadays probably is open cloth.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know if you heard of that.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So his product itself is not any kind of a fancy UI or like some dashboard.\nyusheng kuo: It's actually the agent itself is agent part is harness, like how the agent interact with it, how the agent managed the markdown, manage the contacts, become the product itself.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So it's a very different.\nyusheng kuo: And then nowadays most of those kind of a product are like almost like a personal assistant type of product.\nyusheng kuo: But I believe it will be more.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: But there's a first difference.\nyusheng kuo: So the agent is actually at the core of the product.\nyusheng kuo: So it's very adaptive.\nyusheng kuo: Now how do you know if it is an agent OS type of product or like an agent assistant software is like in a final product.\nyusheng kuo: Does every request actually require agent to reason?\nyusheng kuo: If not, then it's most likely the software.\nyusheng kuo: You have a dashboard, you don't need an agent to run that dashboard.\nyusheng kuo: You click something, it's a very deterministic logic thing or a workflow.\nyusheng kuo: Even Clay, I would say Clay, it has some kind of component inside that's using calling AI API.\nyusheng kuo: But the whole building process is very 2010.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: They try to add some layer to help you to build that.\nyusheng kuo: But the product itself is not the agent at the core.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And one of another very important thing is when you see those kind of agent Assisted software they try to build because they are not using agent to run the thing.\nyusheng kuo: So they build the workflow or dashboard end to end.\nyusheng kuo: So it's like a very big monolithic code.\nyusheng kuo: But in contrast in the agent, the agent always open call still have code.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: But those code are like a tool.\nyusheng kuo: They are small, they are lightweight, they are specifically built for a very small thing.\nyusheng kuo: And then an agent is actually orchestrate all different tool.\nChehan Karunaratne: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: So that's another thing.\nyusheng kuo: And then agent OS like context is actually easier code.\nyusheng kuo: It's kind of your real code once it's actually operating it.\nyusheng kuo: And then the CPU is lln.\nyusheng kuo: But in a clay you don't need the context.\nyusheng kuo: Context doesn't help you.\nyusheng kuo: The more context doesn't really help you.\nyusheng kuo: In your clay example, what this actually implies is when you try to create this agent os, one of the biggest unlock is now you can encode your domain knowledge in a much easier way to scalable software.\nyusheng kuo: Because now you describe what you want to the agent and the agent can follow that.\nyusheng kuo: So you could be able to encode those terminology before.\nyusheng kuo: It's very hard to encode those terminology to a very rigid deterministic way.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: You have to create a lot of even else.\nyusheng kuo: That's why a simple four line description in agent in cloud code will turn into.\nyusheng kuo: One of my friends had nine different table in clay because you have to handle all these different if else condition like a logic.\nyusheng kuo: So that's very hard to encode.\nyusheng kuo: Like every change require a lot of the dependency change to modify the code.\nyusheng kuo: And then the last thing is because now the thing is running by agent.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: It's very adaptive.\nyusheng kuo: It's not blocked by any kind of error.\nyusheng kuo: It's very fluid.\nyusheng kuo: But like in an agent assisted software, because it's monolithic.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like any point it broke, the whole code broke.\nyusheng kuo: I can give you a very vivid example that here.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So this is like our agent output.\nyusheng kuo: So our agent.\nyusheng kuo: I created an agent that's on our platform.\nChehan Karunaratne: I'm not seeing anything on the screen.\nyusheng kuo: Oh yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Now is the time.\nyusheng kuo: Thank you.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, just keep reminding me.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah, for sure.\nyusheng kuo: Can you see my screen now?\nChehan Karunaratne: Yes, yes.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So we deployed an agent called I think called Daily Activity Reporter.\nyusheng kuo: So we deployed this agent and what this agent do is actually every day it will send out this Daily activity report of our product.\nyusheng kuo: So we have 84 users now.\nyusheng kuo: There are three new like at the last week.\nyusheng kuo: And then what's the, the execution?\nyusheng kuo: What, what happened there?\nyusheng kuo: Like some kind of match it like dashboard.\nyusheng kuo: Right, right.\nyusheng kuo: And Then you have something.\nyusheng kuo: This is like the perfect use, perfect case of when, when everything is running smoothly, what happened.\nyusheng kuo: But there is a.\nyusheng kuo: Sometime yesterday actually we have an issue.\nyusheng kuo: We have an outage of a Neo and like you can see the outage of neon.\nyusheng kuo: If it is a traditional newsletter.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: I just wouldn't be able to receive this email because there's the NEON query timeout, which is a database issue that total user count.\nyusheng kuo: And then the metrics couldn't be query.\nyusheng kuo: But Agent kind of know.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, we don't have that.\nyusheng kuo: But we still have other data that we are available.\nyusheng kuo: You still have post Hive data, so you adapt his email format.\nyusheng kuo: Because I'm using skill to build a, to build a report.\nyusheng kuo: So it doesn't.\nyusheng kuo: It's okay that it doesn't have every variable to be fit in.\nyusheng kuo: It will still be able to create this crap, this report for me without just like straight up, like air out.\nyusheng kuo: So that's what I mean, like adapted.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So it's very, very useful because it becomes more actually more robust for any kind of error.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: And like that's where I see actually, like a lot of people, they are now trying to claim, oh, I don't need SaaS.\nyusheng kuo: I build SaaS to replace.\nyusheng kuo: I build some SaaS to save some money.\nyusheng kuo: It's like early Internet.\nyusheng kuo: You try to copy the magazine into a website.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Because that's how you believe that the software should be operated.\nyusheng kuo: But we are seeing that actually it's like whatever is working as a SaaS, just let it work.\nyusheng kuo: You just use it as a tool.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like an API call.\nyusheng kuo: You don't need to replace it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Unless you want to save some money.\nyusheng kuo: But it wouldn't really give you any kind of productivity again.\nyusheng kuo: And if anything, you actually possibly will actually pay more time to maintain those very, very JCoded tool.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: But if you try to treat agent as your core and then build something on top of it, then that's a new software.\nyusheng kuo: And that's where I feel that's where we can start to explore around.\nyusheng kuo: And the core of that is, of course it's agent.\nyusheng kuo: So we will talk about agent today.\nyusheng kuo: The most important thing is how do you build Agent and how do you use it?\nyusheng kuo: Before I tap into like the agent, I want to specifically talk about difference between agent and skills.\nyusheng kuo: Have you heard of a skill?\nyusheng kuo: No.\nChehan Karunaratne: No.\nyusheng kuo: So in cloud code, there's an idea called like skill.\nChehan Karunaratne: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So it basically is a markdown, like a file folder that describe how things should be done.\nyusheng kuo: So it's like reusable capability.\nyusheng kuo: But the agent is more like end to end description.\nyusheng kuo: So one thing I want to emphasize here is when you are building agent in cloud code, you are not writing code to create that.\nyusheng kuo: You are actually writing the instruction and then it will be the same like cloud code loop is like driving it actually.\nyusheng kuo: Have you used cloud code yet?\nyusheng kuo: Did you say you start to.\nyusheng kuo: To kind of explore around it?\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah, I have used it.\nChehan Karunaratne: I created like a CRM using it and it's working properly.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: You build a CRM like.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah, with.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, cool.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Oh right, right.\nyusheng kuo: You.\nyusheng kuo: You mentioned that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So, so you, you probably.\nyusheng kuo: You can try to look up what skill is.\nyusheng kuo: Basically skill is a way for like a specific task, like a generated report.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: It's a.\nyusheng kuo: You can describe the skill later on we will show you what exactly it is.\nChehan Karunaratne: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: But the agent is more like end to end.\nyusheng kuo: Like today I need to generate a daily activity report.\nyusheng kuo: That's my agent's work.\nyusheng kuo: He's responsible for me to do data analysis.\nyusheng kuo: And then to do that actually I use the first skill called like a product analysis skill.\nyusheng kuo: The second is report generator skill.\nyusheng kuo: So generator report adapted.\nyusheng kuo: And then the final is the slack poster or like email poster that to send me the email.\nyusheng kuo: So he know how to use the email example.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So that's what the difference between agent and skill.\nyusheng kuo: And the nice thing if you structure your agent in this way is like your agent can like get improved whenever your skills get improved.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And you don't need to like hard coded that.\nyusheng kuo: So this way your agent is almost like a software.\nyusheng kuo: And then like whatever there's like a skill get updated.\nyusheng kuo: Your.\nyusheng kuo: Your software get updated as well.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah, got it.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so now the, the next step is how to create agent.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So first because we, we need to want to have the agent that's like a, like a job to be done.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And then scale the capability.\nyusheng kuo: So we first need to know how to what's this kind of job to be done.\nyusheng kuo: And then there are many people.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I should just try to complain to Google me.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know why.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so wait, did I lose you again?\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nChehan Karunaratne: No, no, all good.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So there's a certain thing.\nyusheng kuo: It's like let's start by like explaining that a little bit with Kauko.\nyusheng kuo: So here I prefer to use in terminal.\nyusheng kuo: So.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So for example, when you create an agent, right?\nyusheng kuo: You hit slash agent.\nChehan Karunaratne: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: And then you come in and then you can say create new agent.\nyusheng kuo: You see, I already Created certain agent for this one.\nyusheng kuo: I think it's create a new agent.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: I can say it's stay in this project, generate with cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: Have you used this like slash agent?\nChehan Karunaratne: This I haven't used, no.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, yeah, let's try to say, okay, help me to build a ABM agent, account based marketing.\nyusheng kuo: Agent that whenever I, whenever I give you company name or domain, end domain, you will find.\nChehan Karunaratne: I lost you again.\nChehan Karunaratne: Sorry.\nyusheng kuo: Oh no, no, it's not your fault.\nyusheng kuo: It's my fault.\nyusheng kuo: I'm so sorry.\nChehan Karunaratne: No worries.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so I'm just creating a new agent.\nyusheng kuo: So you just describe the agent.\nyusheng kuo: So it's like super easy to create an agent.\nyusheng kuo: You don't need like code and it's actually way better than most of like LAN chain or whatever.\nyusheng kuo: You will find a relevant account like say news for me.\nyusheng kuo: What's your company like say what's your, what's your client now one of your client Shopify.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, for Shopify.\nyusheng kuo: I guess I don't need to explain what Shopify is.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, let's see.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so he now starts.\nyusheng kuo: It's like a meta prompt, right.\nyusheng kuo: So he actually was start to generate a full prompt of the agent.\nyusheng kuo: But what I try to say here is it's good to register your agent here, but it's actually not good to create agent this way.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Damn it.\nChehan Karunaratne: So you think you're saying now when I'm building this a.\nChehan Karunaratne: Like this engine.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nChehan Karunaratne: It should be like a bunch of agents working together or something like that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, is the idea.\nyusheng kuo: Exactly.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that's the idea.\nChehan Karunaratne: So the other question that I have is now there's a certain limit that we can use cloud code for the week.\nChehan Karunaratne: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So.\nChehan Karunaratne: So that is the pro package that I have.\nChehan Karunaratne: Okay.\nChehan Karunaratne: So with that when the agent is running, is that going to like take the tokens or anything?\nyusheng kuo: Take which one?\nChehan Karunaratne: Like the tokens or anything that are, you know, finishing on the clay account.\nChehan Karunaratne: Like when I have the Pro account there's a usage limit, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So in cloud code if you are using it definitely depends on your usage.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So if you are on the $100 limit one then it's like a very generous now.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then today we also just get like Sony 4.6 out.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So I haven't seen token usage become like a huge limiter for me.\nyusheng kuo: It probably also depends on how many account you are monitor.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like a typical how many account you're monitoring.\nChehan Karunaratne: Right.\nChehan Karunaratne: So you have the hundred per month package, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nChehan Karunaratne: Okay.\nChehan Karunaratne: So I have the $20.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah, $20.\nyusheng kuo: So there are certain way to to get away with it.\nyusheng kuo: One is you use the open router and use the Chinese model like G on and Kimi 2.5.\nyusheng kuo: They are also both like good model and then you can access them through the open router.\nyusheng kuo: So you use cloud codes like OS but like a different cpu.\nyusheng kuo: If you think like LLM is like cloud code is operating system.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: If you use cloud you are using Nvidia gpu but you can also use like a cheaper one but also very performant one.\nyusheng kuo: So it will be much cheaper to run.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that would be my suggestion.\nChehan Karunaratne: Right?\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah, I think I can find on YouTube, right.\nChehan Karunaratne: To figure this out.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: If you want to run like in batch, like a lot of them.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so yeah, so.\nyusheng kuo: So here you can see he's trying to create some kind of description.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: But yeah, I would say this is actually not the most ideal way to create agent.\nyusheng kuo: The reason is it has very limited understanding of what actually you want to do.\nyusheng kuo: So that's my point is deploy by doing, not by prompting.\nyusheng kuo: So by doing is you try to create how do you embed your domain knowledge into agent.\nyusheng kuo: Actually you try to do it one time with it and then because he has all the context of the record, right.\nyusheng kuo: So you actually know how to do it like a step by step and he knows what tool you use.\nyusheng kuo: And then that kind of chase become the good enough the context and much better context than when you prompt it.\nyusheng kuo: And so you can actually let it say hey, based on what we done, create an agent for me.\nyusheng kuo: So that's how I would describe it because otherwise you'll find this way to creating problem is like very like a trivial.\nyusheng kuo: It's really not relevant to you.\nyusheng kuo: So that's the second important point.\nyusheng kuo: The third point is like try to make your contacts like treat your context really precious.\nyusheng kuo: So a lot of time when you have like a tool called return, right.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know if you have used MCP and Kauko yet.\nChehan Karunaratne: No, not ncp.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, so.\nyusheng kuo: So if you use MCP like to return Kau code then it will actually give you a very large tool.\nyusheng kuo: But then a good trick is don't just take the context from the tool, make the model, write the tool like write a code to save the tool output.\nyusheng kuo: I have an example here.\nyusheng kuo: Let me create an example here.\nyusheng kuo: Say okay, yeah, so I have a tool called like a linking post tool.\nyusheng kuo: So can you find my.\nyusheng kuo: Let me see what my LinkedIn account is.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, do you find my LinkedIn post from my Datagence MCP linking tool.\nyusheng kuo: So he first will try to find my tool.\nyusheng kuo: So he will pull the external like LinkedIn result.\nyusheng kuo: We search the tool, He found the linking post tool and we tried to execute the tool.\nyusheng kuo: So again this is all like agent is like executing.\nyusheng kuo: It's not just like web research.\nyusheng kuo: He can actually execute a tool.\nyusheng kuo: So okay, let me stop here.\nyusheng kuo: See like when I get this tool, the result is too big, right?\nyusheng kuo: It's like existent maximum allowed token or sometimes even it doesn't exist.\nyusheng kuo: It quickly like bump up your contacts window.\nyusheng kuo: Here you can see my contacts window is 20%.\nyusheng kuo: But if you read it, if you actually accept that it will become the inline context token and it will quickly like lose your contacts, right?\nyusheng kuo: So what's the better way to generate agent is actually say hey, can you.\nChehan Karunaratne: Again.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, can you use data gen SDK to generate the script to save my linking host into temp file?\nyusheng kuo: So what's the difference of that?\nyusheng kuo: So it's like now you let agent.\nyusheng kuo: So he will try to basically try to code a tool.\nyusheng kuo: So that's the thing of our tool.\nyusheng kuo: It's like a data gen tool is like every MCP tool can become the code.\nyusheng kuo: So he tried to.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, he's actually doing that.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so what he's doing is he tried to create a code, right?\nyusheng kuo: To save the tool result into a temp file.\nyusheng kuo: Let's take a look later.\nyusheng kuo: So instead of like getting the full like a tool content back, he saved the tool content into the hard drive.\nyusheng kuo: So that's the strength of Kauko in cloud AI.\nyusheng kuo: You couldn't really do it.\nyusheng kuo: Everything is back to you.\nyusheng kuo: So he saved all 30 posts into here and I can actually ask it.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, help me to find my latest post.\nyusheng kuo: So I don't need to rely on the context window to know what the latest post is.\nyusheng kuo: He can actually persist this as a memory in your context and then he will be able to retrieve it.\nyusheng kuo: Then once I save this way, even I go to the next session.\nyusheng kuo: I can still refer to this file that I did a long time ago to know what the session is.\nyusheng kuo: It become a very lossless way to retrieve your contacts.\nyusheng kuo: Now it's a very common way.\nyusheng kuo: It's using your file as your.\nyusheng kuo: As your memory.\nyusheng kuo: So he actually find out there's.\nyusheng kuo: There's my post on February 12th.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so that's what I mean.\nyusheng kuo: Like you should, when you pull we turn from like not being able to get this tool result like from MCP to be able to effectively use the agent Like a context window.\nyusheng kuo: Like I. I barely move my contacts window.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And I can let my.\nyusheng kuo: I get agent access holder all the contact of my linking post.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then finally there's a few things called validate with hook.\nyusheng kuo: Not hope the things like that.\nyusheng kuo: But let's just get started.\nyusheng kuo: To build one of your agent.\nyusheng kuo: Like for real.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: So I create a.\nyusheng kuo: Let's just clear that.\nyusheng kuo: Wait, what's that?\nChehan Karunaratne: You can send me this recording later, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, well, yeah, yeah, we have a firefly that's like.\nyusheng kuo: Like you have a transcript also.\nyusheng kuo: I will send you this documentation.\nyusheng kuo: So awesome.\nChehan Karunaratne: Okay, thank you so much.\nyusheng kuo: I create, I create a skill here called how to create agent.\nyusheng kuo: And then let's say I want to build an ABN agent for Spotify.\nyusheng kuo: Which account you want to tap into?\nChehan Karunaratne: Shopify.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Or Shopify.\nyusheng kuo: Give me like a real account so we can like basically see how.\nyusheng kuo: How like how I would.\nyusheng kuo: So Shopify is your.\nyusheng kuo: Spotify is your client, right?\nyusheng kuo: It's an account you wanna.\nyusheng kuo: You wanted your client to lend?\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah, sure.\nChehan Karunaratne: Shopify is actually a client.\nChehan Karunaratne: So Twilio or Zoom is also one of our clients.\nyusheng kuo: So but like who do you want them to like you are doing account based marketing for them, right?\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah, we are doing account based marketing for them.\nChehan Karunaratne: So it can be like an ABM agent for Shopify as well.\nChehan Karunaratne: Because we are trying to like create a signal based thing so that we can sell it to them to do.\nChehan Karunaratne: For them to do marketing and you know, reach out on time for their clients as well.\nyusheng kuo: So okay, so you want to learn the signal for Shopify?\nyusheng kuo: Yes, for.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, for, for Shopify.\nyusheng kuo: And can you give me some kind of idea, idea of how this should be down?\nyusheng kuo: Like just give it a little bit.\nChehan Karunaratne: You are saying a type of signal or something like that?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Like what do you want to learn from that?\nyusheng kuo: Like I want.\nChehan Karunaratne: So whether Shopify is, let's say the companies that Shopify is going after expanding into the Australian region, you know like the APAC region or like the funding rounds or something like that.\nChehan Karunaratne: Or they are hiring a new marketing manager in apac, you know, a marketing leader in apac.\nyusheng kuo: Do you want to learn if.\nyusheng kuo: If they are expanding in aircraft?\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Is that the right word or.\nyusheng kuo: No?\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah, for sure.\nChehan Karunaratne: So let's do that first, you know, so.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, sorry, I'm not expert at that.\nyusheng kuo: Or like hiring some executive here.\nChehan Karunaratne: Let's say marketing leader.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah, okay, no worries.\nyusheng kuo: Oh yeah, yeah, sorry.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Oh we can actually just say.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, sorry Mark.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so I Just change it to some marketing lead.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nChehan Karunaratne: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So this.\nyusheng kuo: This scale actually you can see from.\nyusheng kuo: You couldn't see, but it's basically telling you like a step by step.\nyusheng kuo: First it would try to interview you.\nyusheng kuo: What does the IPO look out like a structured report, a Slack alert or email brief.\nyusheng kuo: You say just give me an email brief.\nyusheng kuo: In the end, what signal matter most for Apex Engine?\nyusheng kuo: Start posting news npr we can just say.\nyusheng kuo: And you can also say something else.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Let's do this for now because later on you can play with that.\nyusheng kuo: I will just give you.\nyusheng kuo: And then you just need to open in cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: And then you can use this skill.\nyusheng kuo: That's what the skill for.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: And let's say let's do a daily agent.\nyusheng kuo: Run a weekly agent round, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Submit the answer now.\nyusheng kuo: The next thing is, okay, let's try to create a context for this thing.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: What are the.\nyusheng kuo: The important contacts is like okay, he created this agent called like a Shopify ABN intel.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And let's try to develop by doing so he tried to first try to search like what are the job posting.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then he tried to find some tool.\nyusheng kuo: And let's say.\nyusheng kuo: Let's just keep it simple for this one because you don't have as many tools as I have.\nyusheng kuo: So we can say just focus on your internal web research tool.\nyusheng kuo: But of course like later on if you have some API that some tool that or mcp, you can add it.\nyusheng kuo: But here for us we just say like using internal web research tool to research them.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: The key is how to do research.\nyusheng kuo: So here's a.\nyusheng kuo: We are getting into the like the manual process and then you will guide me.\nyusheng kuo: You know, he just try to just.\nyusheng kuo: Just use.\nyusheng kuo: I have so many different web research web search.\nyusheng kuo: Like I have like a parallel which is pretty good actually.\nyusheng kuo: I would recommend like the next step is add more this kind of specialty tool like a sas.\nyusheng kuo: It's like a US SAS for your agent.\nyusheng kuo: They assess for your agent.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nChehan Karunaratne: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And the next I will try to lay down the ground like very different dossier.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like for example, like what type of content you want to have.\nyusheng kuo: So that's like a very different thing compared to like clay.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: You can create this kind of content for the signal.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: So he said, oh wow.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: So let's.\nyusheng kuo: I would say okay, let's create a folder with hiring signal hiring Dynamd News md.\nyusheng kuo: What else?\nyusheng kuo: Like.\nyusheng kuo: Some company PR, MD related to impact IMD.\nyusheng kuo: So this folder will contain all of this and later on your agent can actually continue to record this like this markdown like this content into this hiring md.\nyusheng kuo: So it's not like a stateless.\nyusheng kuo: Right, so it will continue to see the trace of that.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so we have that.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: And that become your content.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: So he start to fill out this context for it.\nChehan Karunaratne: So when you are creating this issuing like is this plan mode or.\nyusheng kuo: Right now I'm not in plan mode.\nyusheng kuo: I just like yeah, you can, you can do it in plan mode.\nyusheng kuo: But for now I just like create it in.\nyusheng kuo: Sorry, Yeah, right now I just create like in edit mode.\nyusheng kuo: Now actually I would recommend to go in climb up.\nyusheng kuo: I'm like going lazy.\nyusheng kuo: Sorry for that.\nyusheng kuo: But yeah, here is like he basically created this like a news company post APAC higher and IMD each file what to look for signal strength, where to search, want to proceed to write the agent IMD file V. Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, now he tried to update the agent.\nyusheng kuo: I would say can you.\nyusheng kuo: So can you summarize last year as.\nChehan Karunaratne: Soon as you did that?\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then now here's a summarization step, right?\nyusheng kuo: So we try to create a step.\nyusheng kuo: We try to prepare the context layer and then we try to basically have to prepare the context interview ourselves and we look up the current agent format.\nyusheng kuo: We codify.\nyusheng kuo: Now we need to codify the agent definition.\nyusheng kuo: So which basically when you.\nyusheng kuo: When I say codify, just like because for example he tried to do something, we say no, don't do that.\nyusheng kuo: And then we try to search, we say okay, create something.\nyusheng kuo: So that's like a very manual way of creating that for one time.\nyusheng kuo: But then we now can have all the context of what we've done.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And then we can just say okay, can you summarize what we have done and update the agent that we just created?\nyusheng kuo: What's that called?\nyusheng kuo: I forget what the agent we created because I think he tried to create a new agent for Shopify abm.\nyusheng kuo: But we can just say what's the agent we created?\nyusheng kuo: Oh, I deleted that.\nyusheng kuo: Let me see.\nyusheng kuo: So we create the.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, we didn't actually.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so we just say yes, summarize what we did and create this Shopify ABN agent.\nyusheng kuo: Make sure to follow our cloud pro create agent.\nyusheng kuo: So now ideally he would try to summarize what we did as a trace.\nyusheng kuo: Then we can see it.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so he just tried it.\nyusheng kuo: So he tried to look up how to create the agent in Calcutt guy.\nyusheng kuo: It's like their internal documentation.\nyusheng kuo: So that way they don't try to invent Some weird, like a format.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nChehan Karunaratne: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: But he also reads some other agent I created.\nyusheng kuo: Mm.\nyusheng kuo: Give me one second.\nyusheng kuo: Done.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, So he just finished the understanding of calculation.\nyusheng kuo: Now he tried to write the agent.\nChehan Karunaratne: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So one important thing is like throughout the whole time we didn't try to write any code.\nyusheng kuo: We just describe our process or we should show them, not describe, like we show them our process.\nyusheng kuo: So I would recommend if you want a good abm, the most important thing is like get to the point that you feel you have a really good ABM signal.\nyusheng kuo: I can do whatever it takes, like ask a question, fix the contact until you get a real good ABM signal.\nyusheng kuo: And that become the superpower of your agent.\nyusheng kuo: And that would be like comp.\nyusheng kuo: Much better than whatever is on the, on the market.\nChehan Karunaratne: Okay.\nChehan Karunaratne: So from my understanding, I'm using versus code.\nChehan Karunaratne: Okay, so I just use the cloud code chat over there, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nChehan Karunaratne: And continue to prompt it until the agent finds a proper signal.\nyusheng kuo: Exactly, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Until he finds something like here we didn't go to the hiring IMD news IMD company post.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: It didn't.\nyusheng kuo: Probably something very generic.\nyusheng kuo: But like just push it, push it until you get like a really good message, really good signal.\nyusheng kuo: And then the process of that become the superpower of your agent because he knows what you don't like what you like.\nyusheng kuo: You know, it's like the chase is your contact.\nyusheng kuo: It's much better than you try to prompt it and try to pump it.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: It's very hard to pump it.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so he said web search only, right?\nyusheng kuo: He tried to do this, but I say a parallel search.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Screen based output to this Shopify JSON to create this output so that he already know he would try to create a script.\nyusheng kuo: So you can later on revisit those scripts.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And signal classification like a high median low for a context file structure brief compile.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: To test it, we should just restart the cloud code.\nyusheng kuo: So now if you see like he even created, even he created this agent there and you can see a cloud.\nyusheng kuo: See even you have the Shopify ABN here, right?\nyusheng kuo: MD here you wouldn't be able to see it here.\nyusheng kuo: Like you don't see it here.\nyusheng kuo: It should be in project.\nyusheng kuo: The reason is like cloud code doesn't hard reload.\nyusheng kuo: So I already in our skill say what you should do, you should restart the cloud code and then resume to this session.\nyusheng kuo: Cloud R will resume to this session.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nyusheng kuo: So you just control C and then cloud R. Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So now let's see again.\nyusheng kuo: See now your Agent is here, right?\nChehan Karunaratne: I lost you.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, sorry.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, just need to like after you develop the agent you need to like restart and resume the session.\nyusheng kuo: You just cloud get out and then type cloud R. Now you have the Shopify ABM agent here and now.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, you can just ask it to do it.\nyusheng kuo: But let's do one more step which you don't have the access.\nyusheng kuo: But last time we can say is like let's deploy this agent so you can run on like weekly.\nyusheng kuo: So let's see how to go.\nyusheng kuo: So now he uses another skill called how to deploy agent and after this that's we can conclude the process.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yes.\nChehan Karunaratne: So you're saying you said I can't, I don't have access or something.\nChehan Karunaratne: I didn't get that.\nyusheng kuo: So it was it.\nChehan Karunaratne: No, when, when I, when you said like deploy this agent you said I don't have access to do that something.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, because it's like you need like you need to be a data gen user to deploy this agent way, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But you get like if you want to try, I don't know if you want to try.\nyusheng kuo: If you want to try, we can give you like a free credit and then, and now we can have a more tutorial on how to do it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so.\nyusheng kuo: So it's like you can you see like there's a CoIQ one page engine but today I just try to show.\nyusheng kuo: Because we don't have time to go into all the detail but again you can just like log into this data gen as a user and then use this skill.\nyusheng kuo: This skill will try to show you how to do it.\nyusheng kuo: I didn't do anything.\nyusheng kuo: The first thing you actually create a GitHub because you need to use GitHub to version control it.\nyusheng kuo: Let's just let it run.\nyusheng kuo: He tried to push the agent file to GitHub.\nyusheng kuo: That's how you deploy.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, and then he add this push to the main.\nyusheng kuo: But let's see later on this will show up, connect repo and discover agent.\nyusheng kuo: So wow.\nyusheng kuo: It's just end to end.\nyusheng kuo: I do it.\nyusheng kuo: So okay, Yeah, he tried to figure it out because he's using the command line.\nyusheng kuo: So he's like the supervisor is like if you give the agent command line interface he would just.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, he found it, he found the support agent.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And then he found this Shopify AVN agent.\nyusheng kuo: He started deploy, let's see, successfully now set up the weekly schedule.\nyusheng kuo: So now he's trying to set a weekly schedule.\nyusheng kuo: It's like why is the age of type A I'M in Austin.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know why, but later on you can ask it to.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so here's the final result.\nyusheng kuo: So you can give your whatever API or like a clay, right this webhook.\nyusheng kuo: So clay will just send the company here and then here's your agent id and he will, or if you don't run any specific thing, will try to run this agent like every day.\nyusheng kuo: I am type 8 time.\nyusheng kuo: Wait, what?\nyusheng kuo: How does he know I'm Taiwanese?\nyusheng kuo: That's weird, but never mind.\nyusheng kuo: Wait, what?\nyusheng kuo: I don't know why he know I'm Taiwanese.\nyusheng kuo: Even like I'm in Austin, Texas.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so.\nyusheng kuo: So let's try to run it actually and see how it goes first if you go to the agent, you can also see that here.\nyusheng kuo: If you prefer ui, I prefer command line because it's like, like you see, like I don't need to click any button you just figured out for me.\nyusheng kuo: And then I say how to deploy and he just deploy all the way in the end.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, exactly.\nyusheng kuo: But you can see here's how to build agent.\nyusheng kuo: You can see your spot shopify AOE agents here.\nyusheng kuo: And then you have this entry prompt saying you should weekly shopify Report, research, highlight news, print.\nyusheng kuo: Here's a prompt of how this run this agent.\nyusheng kuo: The description is it just the same as whatever in your cloud here it's like cloud agent.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's the same.\nyusheng kuo: It's just like auto discover for you.\nyusheng kuo: So you don't need to take care deployment everything and surrounding cloud.\nyusheng kuo: So you can run like whenever you want.\nyusheng kuo: It can be triggered by your external system.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, yeah, let's try to run it.\nyusheng kuo: Test, test lion.\nyusheng kuo: So now you just create an agent, right?\nyusheng kuo: Like in cal code.\nyusheng kuo: Now you can like trigger that when you are in Kauko.\nyusheng kuo: But now it's like.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, you can trigger that when you are not in cloud code like every day, every week.\nyusheng kuo: You could create one for each account basically.\nyusheng kuo: And then.\nyusheng kuo: Right, and then once it's running, it's actually here.\nyusheng kuo: See, he's running.\nyusheng kuo: He's trying to run the agent also see that it just.\nyusheng kuo: You don't see that, but agents see that.\nyusheng kuo: You try to wait for it to finish.\nChehan Karunaratne: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, Should take a while.\nyusheng kuo: You wait for 60 minutes, 60 seconds.\nyusheng kuo: Do some research.\nyusheng kuo: Web research.\nyusheng kuo: A bunch of web research.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But now you don't need to like think of like you can basically scale yourself, right?\nyusheng kuo: Because you do it once you know how to do a good AVN agent, that's it's not on the market.\nyusheng kuo: How to do AVN and you can give it more tool whether through API key or through MCP tool to like give it like a parallel.\nyusheng kuo: Like one of the tool I really like is called parallel.\nyusheng kuo: So you can also add the MCP server directly on datagen.\nyusheng kuo: Whatever you added here will be available to the data agent.\nyusheng kuo: It's like I have a bunch of MCP here.\nyusheng kuo: I can ask parallel search.\nyusheng kuo: I really like this one.\nyusheng kuo: It's like a really good web research.\nyusheng kuo: Much better.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, sorry.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So where are we?\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, here, here I have all the MCP server.\nyusheng kuo: Whatever MCP server you added here will be available to the agent.\nyusheng kuo: And like I really like this.\nyusheng kuo: I really highly recommend this parallel search.\nyusheng kuo: It's like really good quality.\nyusheng kuo: Much better quality than Qualco actually.\nChehan Karunaratne: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And I have like a Firefly and a slack so I can like send.\nyusheng kuo: Send the result or send an email, whatever post hog or for me like instant.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know what type of marketing thing you guys typically use.\nyusheng kuo: Like a signal base, right?\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah.\nChehan Karunaratne: Signal base.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yes.\nChehan Karunaratne: To find signals you're saying, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nChehan Karunaratne: Signal base is actually a really good one.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, well it's like a long running.\nyusheng kuo: It does a lot of things.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, let's give it a minute.\nyusheng kuo: Four times.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, he really tried to.\nChehan Karunaratne: Right.\nChehan Karunaratne: So you saying.\nChehan Karunaratne: Okay, so what I basically have to do is like when I'm about to deploy, I have to connect it with one of your data gen.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nChehan Karunaratne: Agents you're saying?\nChehan Karunaratne: Oh yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: It is an agent.\nyusheng kuo: Like a running.\nChehan Karunaratne: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's an agent.\nyusheng kuo: Okay here actually I think he finally create a company post.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nChehan Karunaratne: So definitely.\nyusheng kuo: And then the thing is like the thing is be careful when you try to deploy.\nyusheng kuo: That is you need to set up.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, sorry, I skipped a few things probably because I actually create this.\nyusheng kuo: Where is it?\nyusheng kuo: Where's our abn?\nyusheng kuo: Where's our.\nyusheng kuo: This one.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, here.\nyusheng kuo: This one.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Don't use the API key.\nyusheng kuo: Use your cloud code oauth token and I can show you how to do it.\nyusheng kuo: You just like go to cloud.\nyusheng kuo: Go to cloud and type cloud.\nyusheng kuo: Cloud Cloud setup token.\nyusheng kuo: It actually will give you the old token.\nyusheng kuo: What this does is you can use your $20 subscription to replace your API cost.\nyusheng kuo: And then like everyone know it's actually much cheaper to use the subscription compared to API cost.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, right.\nyusheng kuo: Got it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Let's see if it's finished.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, you finished.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So once it finished.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: It will send me the email.\nChehan Karunaratne: Okay, awesome.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: See.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, here.\nyusheng kuo: Completed high signal strength across all categories.\nyusheng kuo: So every week you would get this like the hiring signal very critical.\nyusheng kuo: There's a head of marketing is.\nyusheng kuo: Is actually like hiring.\nChehan Karunaratne: That's true.\nyusheng kuo: Like this is not good because I wanted to give me my citation.\nyusheng kuo: Like what actually he.\nyusheng kuo: Where he found it.\nyusheng kuo: When is that right.\nyusheng kuo: You can actually give it more useful context.\nyusheng kuo: So he gave it a recommend.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah, I lost.\nyusheng kuo: I lost you.\nyusheng kuo: Oh sorry so bad.\nyusheng kuo: I would just sue Google me like tomorrow.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So he actually sent me an email.\nyusheng kuo: Is there everything you can configure in like in your agent?\nyusheng kuo: You just go to like here find a notification and then you can just email and you can send more people.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Not just you, you can send to your boss like oh like whoever need to be monitor this tool, this agent, this account will actually all get this email.\nyusheng kuo: And the cool thing is you can reply to this email.\nyusheng kuo: So this is like what I mean like agent is like oh like where do you.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, we probably don't need to wait but where do you find the information about this?\nyusheng kuo: Next time update your go update the skill no agent file.\nyusheng kuo: Because we didn't use skill.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: We didn't get the chance to cover skill for today.\nyusheng kuo: Agent file to always include the reference citation.\nyusheng kuo: Like.\nyusheng kuo: Like a link.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: So it sent back actually it would trigger our agent to run again.\nChehan Karunaratne: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it would actually trigger our agent run again.\nyusheng kuo: And then, and then.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah it would just like back and forth.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So that's why, that's, that's why I say it's like it's underlying.\nyusheng kuo: It's no longer just a simple like See you already started to queue the agent and then here's the.\nyusheng kuo: The thing.\nyusheng kuo: I actually wanted to run.\nChehan Karunaratne: Right, right.\nyusheng kuo: So like you are, you are your boss.\nyusheng kuo: If you give it the owner access he can reply too.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And get the report.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah.\nChehan Karunaratne: So you see now once we reply to this now it's going to learn from that and you know keep on learning basically on how to do this.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: You wanted to update right?\nyusheng kuo: And then yeah like once it updates then the file get better and better.\nyusheng kuo: But always that's the nice thing about not using open cop but using cloud code is like be aware of what actually the guidance look like.\nyusheng kuo: Always be willing to go into hygiene.\nyusheng kuo: Otherwise you're just like.\nyusheng kuo: Like it would like accumulate crap.\nyusheng kuo: You know what I'm saying?\nyusheng kuo: That's my.\nyusheng kuo: My learning.\nyusheng kuo: It's like yeah, the original.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, so he already showing.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, keep push fail.\nyusheng kuo: There's a failure.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Return error.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, there's something going on.\nyusheng kuo: I don't know why.\nyusheng kuo: Oh Wait, I think I know why.\nyusheng kuo: Because I didn't give it access.\nyusheng kuo: But basically if it doesn't, it's like if you.\nyusheng kuo: If you give it the.\nyusheng kuo: The access because I didn't give it access to this how to be agent, you will get the result back.\nyusheng kuo: Like it here.\nyusheng kuo: Good.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So how.\nChehan Karunaratne: How do you give access?\nyusheng kuo: You have to go to the.\nyusheng kuo: Let me just show you quickly like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, here I ask you something and so can you tell me more about this tool that he's running?\nyusheng kuo: And he just replied unfortunately I'm running into some issue but here's a tool the execution success way this kind of reply.\nyusheng kuo: So the way you give it access is you.\nyusheng kuo: This is weird mission to how to be agent.\nyusheng kuo: I feel it's something deeper.\nyusheng kuo: Why?\nyusheng kuo: Let me try to.\nyusheng kuo: Because I already give it access.\nyusheng kuo: Let me try to refresh it.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, this is weird.\nyusheng kuo: Oh oh, I see.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Because I didn't give it my GitHub access token.\nyusheng kuo: So in the agent, right.\nyusheng kuo: If you wanted like it to change it with thing like basically make GitHub change.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: You need to give him the.\nyusheng kuo: I don't have it here, but you need to give it the GitHub token.\nyusheng kuo: I don't have GitHub token.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: So you can go to GitHub and give it a GitHub access token to make change of your GitHub.\nyusheng kuo: So he would just change on his own.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So that's why he kind of fell because I didn't give it the API key to do that thing.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so.\nyusheng kuo: But.\nyusheng kuo: But yeah, that's like overall how you can do it.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: We actually, we can just try to say this.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Don't.\nyusheng kuo: Don't need to change the skill.\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Because when you change the skill you need to give it access to.\nyusheng kuo: Just show me your.\nyusheng kuo: Let's see.\nyusheng kuo: But yeah, you just like you can back and forth discuss it with that.\nyusheng kuo: And then the nice thing about email is like you can paralyze right.\nyusheng kuo: Again, go parallel like you can continue if you have so many different agents, they all can like running in parallel.\nyusheng kuo: It's not like a slack like you have so many different.\nyusheng kuo: But in the same time.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then you can share this with your boss.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: You can forward this to your boss.\nyusheng kuo: You can get email notification whenever there's a strong signal coming in.\nyusheng kuo: You don't need to go ahead basically have a bot like continue to monitor for you.\nyusheng kuo: I know people are using it for crypto type of thing, but because those type of thing you want it to be autonomously, right.\nyusheng kuo: Not like follow you around.\nChehan Karunaratne: So you should.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, but here's a thing.\nyusheng kuo: It's like the link, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, cool.\nyusheng kuo: Go ahead.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah, so basically when I'm using this, what I need to know is like am I completely using my tokens in cloud code?\nChehan Karunaratne: Like the package that I have?\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah, yeah.\nChehan Karunaratne: Is that, is that how I'm using it when I'm running?\nyusheng kuo: Yes, yes.\nyusheng kuo: It's not using ours.\nyusheng kuo: So we won't charge you for like a token, like renting fee.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: You just use your own token.\nyusheng kuo: So if you don't give it a token you can deport the agent.\nyusheng kuo: So you have to give it either endw.\nyusheng kuo: So for example, if I, if I delete this one.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, I. I wouldn't, I wouldn't be able to run like a deployment.\nChehan Karunaratne: I like what I mean is like from data gen, from one of your.\nChehan Karunaratne: What do you call it?\nChehan Karunaratne: I can get an API right?\nChehan Karunaratne: Like without using the tokens on Claude, right?\nChehan Karunaratne: The package that I have.\nyusheng kuo: Sorry, can you say again?\nChehan Karunaratne: No, like you said before to use my existing subscription tokens, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, for data gen.\nChehan Karunaratne: But without doing that, can.\nChehan Karunaratne: I can get your API right as well?\nChehan Karunaratne: So I have to get API tokens?\nyusheng kuo: Yes.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, you can use this Coco Oath token and then if you have cloud already, right.\nyusheng kuo: You can just basically run this.\nyusheng kuo: Can you see my screen?\nChehan Karunaratne: No.\nyusheng kuo: I should probably like have a tutorial on this thing.\nyusheng kuo: So you just type here in your VS code like cloud setup token.\nyusheng kuo: Right?\nChehan Karunaratne: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: You don't need to apply for API key.\nyusheng kuo: You just type this setup token.\nyusheng kuo: Okay, Let me actually copy this to you so you can see it.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah, it's in the recording.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So setup token will actually prompt you to log in.\nyusheng kuo: So I say authorize.\nyusheng kuo: So it will give you a token worth value for a year.\nyusheng kuo: See, here's your token value for one year.\nyusheng kuo: And you just need to create this cloud oauth token.\nyusheng kuo: And let me show you how like you go to here and you go to like account setting.\nyusheng kuo: You have secret, right?\nyusheng kuo: And you can just add it.\nyusheng kuo: Secret name just calcaos token.\nyusheng kuo: It has to be calculus token.\nyusheng kuo: That's like what you get here and then on the value side you just copy this one and then put it here.\nChehan Karunaratne: Got it.\nyusheng kuo: I think.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, you have to like he like cloud code have some new line.\nyusheng kuo: So make sure you don't have a new line otherwise this API won't work.\nyusheng kuo: Like early on I have this like he created a new line here.\nyusheng kuo: So you have to make sure it doesn't have a new Line.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, right.\nyusheng kuo: The way I check is I try to check if the last character get deleted.\nyusheng kuo: Yes, right, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: And then you can give us some description that the.\nyusheng kuo: The important thing is just secret name like the star and then the secret value.\nChehan Karunaratne: Got it.\nyusheng kuo: Make sure it has to be cloud code or token otherwise the cloud wouldn't recognize it.\nyusheng kuo: And once you give it, you can just start to run it and yeah, if you're interested in running the agent using our data gen, just give me a call or just let me know.\nyusheng kuo: I can, I can give you some like a free credit.\nyusheng kuo: It's actually now it's free to run this deploy agent.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So if you, if you're interested.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, try it.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah.\nChehan Karunaratne: So you think my plan is to like definitely like building these agents so this agent would act as a like a own person who is going on, you know, like going and searching on the web.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Follow your instruction.\nyusheng kuo: Follow your instruction.\nyusheng kuo: So your instruction is very important.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, right.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, once you have a good ABN agent, let me know, I want to know what it look like.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah, for sure.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nChehan Karunaratne: Because so as we are iterating and you know, as we are prompting it.\nChehan Karunaratne: Prompting it, you know.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah, to okay, not this, do this change and search for it next time.\nChehan Karunaratne: Likewise, it's going to learn, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nChehan Karunaratne: And at the end of will come to a proper standard.\nyusheng kuo: Right, yeah, yeah.\nChehan Karunaratne: Okay, got it, got it.\nyusheng kuo: And just continue to some say hey, based on what we learned.\nyusheng kuo: Summarize what we did.\nyusheng kuo: Update the agent file.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah.\nChehan Karunaratne: So basically what I want to do is like use your API without you know like overwhelming my Claude account, you know like.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah, so that I'm able to use it longer because the 20 limit is, you know, it runs out really quickly.\nChehan Karunaratne: Okay, yeah.\nChehan Karunaratne: So I don't want to overwhelm it, you know, by using yeah over here as well.\nChehan Karunaratne: So yes, I see if I like with the free credits and all, if I show it okay this way works properly then you know I can talk to the management and I can get this for the company basically.\nyusheng kuo: Oh yeah, sure, that works if you want because so you want to try out like using our token like a consumption because we have like a higher limit and then if you.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, that works.\nyusheng kuo: So once you created the agent, let me know I can run it for you and basically like you because it was sent an email, I just need to add you in the email list.\nyusheng kuo: Right, got it.\nyusheng kuo: And then.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, so you just need to focus on creating a good agent description.\nChehan Karunaratne: Got it.\nyusheng kuo: And I will take Care of the deployment.\nyusheng kuo: And then.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, if your company like it, then, and, and then you can ask them to give you like a higher limit of the Calco.\nyusheng kuo: Because I, I really feel this will be a new, different way to do research.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: You don't.\nyusheng kuo: You just deploy a bunch of agents.\nyusheng kuo: It's much cheaper than you buying some like a very expensive like, like, like rocks or whatever, right?\nyusheng kuo: You're just using your car code.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, exactly.\nChehan Karunaratne: So you think I.\nChehan Karunaratne: Another small confusion there.\nChehan Karunaratne: So I'm not going to like ask them to increase my code code.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, okay.\nyusheng kuo: Okay.\nChehan Karunaratne: To get your APIs, API tokens or something like that.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: So.\nyusheng kuo: So one thing is like here, this is your like cloud co token, right?\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So what, what's your plan then?\nyusheng kuo: If you are not using the cloud code API in the end you want.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, you say if you can buy from us, is that the longer plan or what?\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah.\nChehan Karunaratne: What is.\nChehan Karunaratne: How is that?\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, we.\nyusheng kuo: But it would be cheaper like if you use your own cloud code actually compared to buy.\nChehan Karunaratne: Overwhelming.\nChehan Karunaratne: Right?\nyusheng kuo: What, what do you mean?\nChehan Karunaratne: Like it will overwhelm the cloud.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nChehan Karunaratne: Like fast.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Oh, so you want like a separate, like a cloud code account.\nyusheng kuo: It's like different from your personal user, like.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nChehan Karunaratne: So basically what, where I'm confused is like when I'm running this agent in Claude, right?\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nChehan Karunaratne: Does it take like, does it take a lot of my usage of the cloud account that I have?\nChehan Karunaratne: You know, there's a limit now for the week and the, for the day.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nChehan Karunaratne: Okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, it would use.\nyusheng kuo: It were used.\nyusheng kuo: But if you, if you prompt like your agent properly, then it's very little.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, it's much minimal.\nyusheng kuo: It's just like in the end of the day, you don't need to use Qualcomm, you don't need to use Anthropic model.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Like in the beginning I said you can use glm.\nyusheng kuo: Those models are pretty good too.\nyusheng kuo: But in the end you still need to pay some inference to someone, right?\nyusheng kuo: It depends on who you.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nChehan Karunaratne: So I think I'll just jump in and I'll start doing this and once I'm done with it, I'll get.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, you can try to.\nyusheng kuo: You can try.\nyusheng kuo: I think the path I am seeing is that you can first try to create your agent locally.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: And deploy that and see how it goes and maybe show to your manager or maybe say, hey, maybe here's a way for you to do account research very effectively.\nyusheng kuo: And it's much cheaper actually compared to Clay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: Because Clay is Like you use those API and it's a very like a most of a clay because when he do research it's like a very.\nyusheng kuo: It's like each column is a context and then you just summarize the context like the column.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: That's how clay do it.\nyusheng kuo: But here you can give a very specific like procedure instead of like a process of doing research.\nyusheng kuo: Not just like based on the this five different resource.\nyusheng kuo: Like give me the A report and then you can ask it.\nyusheng kuo: Right.\nyusheng kuo: Continue to improve it.\nyusheng kuo: So yeah, if you, if you think your company will be interested in this type of a platform we can discuss like for example, like we pay for the cloud code and you get you guys basically we will help you to manage this.\nyusheng kuo: You guys are creating your like using your own CAL code to do it.\nyusheng kuo: But like I say like underlying is you have to pay some LLM to do the research.\nyusheng kuo: Research.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nChehan Karunaratne: I totally get it.\nChehan Karunaratne: So thank you so much yushing for talking to me today and this was really, really helpful and so much value here.\nyusheng kuo: Thank you.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah, yeah, thank you so much.\nChehan Karunaratne: And yeah, what is the best way that I can reach you?\nChehan Karunaratne: Is it LinkedIn?\nyusheng kuo: LinkedIn probably is now the easiest way.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: What do you use?\nChehan Karunaratne: I use Slack LinkedIn.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: So okay.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, yeah, I'm not like a slack user.\nyusheng kuo: I'm using discord.\nChehan Karunaratne: Yeah.\nyusheng kuo: But LinkedIn.\nyusheng kuo: LinkedIn is working for me.\nyusheng kuo: WhatsApp is also another way that you can reach me.\nyusheng kuo: But yeah, let me know when you have a good ABN agent that you feel comfortable with.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, let me know.\nyusheng kuo: I will, I will try to deploy that and then see how it goes.\nyusheng kuo: Like see if actually would make you more responsive.\nChehan Karunaratne: For sure.\nChehan Karunaratne: Thank you so much.\nChehan Karunaratne: I took about one and a half hours of your time, so thank you so much.\nyusheng kuo: Oh yeah, no, it's a pleasure.\nyusheng kuo: Yeah, have a good one.\nyusheng kuo: And also let me send you this GitHub so later on you can, you can play around with it.\nChehan Karunaratne: If you can send me the recording, it would be great.\nyusheng kuo: Oh yeah, sure.\nyusheng kuo: Thank you.\nChehan Karunaratne: All right, bye bye, bye.\nTitle: 30 Min Meeting between Yusheng Kuo and Chehan
