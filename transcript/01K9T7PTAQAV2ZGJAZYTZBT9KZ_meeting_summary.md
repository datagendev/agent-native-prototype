### Pain Points & Challenges Discussed

#### Pain Point 1: Product-Market Fit for MCP Middleware
**Description:** Extreme difficulty proving ROI and value for MCP as a standalone middleware product. Developers prefer building custom solutions, and end-users don't see immediate value.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "It's so hard to prove roi... Once you measure it, everyone and their grandmother wants a slice of the metric. Just its own PM the director of engineering. No, no, no. Like yeah, the MCP helped a bit but it was my policy or my management."

> "It's like so hard to position because you couldn't position to dev dev developer tool. Not really. Because like dead people were like, oh I would just like develop my own like MCP tool if it's like only few of them."

> "Maybe MCP is just not a good business to be. It's just going to be honest like just like that's it."

---

#### Pain Point 2: Middleware Attribution Problem
**Description:** When productivity improvements happen, multiple stakeholders claim credit, making it impossible to attribute value directly to middleware tools like MCP.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "Oh, it's gonna improve your developer productivity. Do you measure that? No. Once you measure it, everyone and their grandmother wants a slice of the metric."

---

#### Pain Point 3: Lack of Mainstream User Value
**Description:** MCP and personal assistant agents don't provide clear value to everyday users. Early adopters are only hardcore developers, not mainstream consumers.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "Daily average Joe 9 to 5 Instagram TikTok. Like why the does he need a personal assistant? Like why like what would this person use the personal assistant for?"

> "So mcp like the first early adopters of MCP were developers. Workaholic. The perspective."

> "Just your everyday consumer will care about this thing or will see ROI from this. So when MCP is combined with entertainment. That's when the big blow up will happen."

---

#### Pain Point 4: MCP Is in "Tarpit Phase"
**Description:** MCP requires ecosystem maturity, vendor cooperation, and years of patient development before reaching commercial viability. Missing critical features like authentication.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "To be honest I. I think it's a tarpit at some point it won't be a tarpit but I think it's still in the tarpit phase in my. In my opinion."

> "It will have its commercial moment like first principle. It just like makes sense. Something happened happens like not even MCP specifically. That's just a 2 falling in the middleware. That's just not now that's a now in my opinion just a pure psychological endurance."

> "Like authentication for example. Like there's no authentication building... Even even protocol itself can support it. Just don't spend time like yeah yeah yeah."

---

#### Pain Point 5: Agent Memory Solutions Lack True Value
**Description:** Current "memory" solutions for agents are just retrieval systems, not real memory. They don't provide ROI beyond minor token reduction.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "When I use a memory solution I don't, I'm not like I shouldn't be. I shouldn't be using a memory solution to reduce token usage priority. I'm not sure that memory hasn't really landed yet."

> "Yeah, I don't think any of Asian memory are a real memory. They are more like just still like a retrieval thing in the end of the day."

---

#### Pain Point 6: Personal Assistant Use Case Lacks Compelling Value
**Description:** General personal assistants don't solve clear pain points for most professionals. More value in narrow, specific assistants (research, PowerPoint, etc.).

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "Even if you're targeting professional white collar consultants, investment bankers, lawyers like personal assistant research. I have a research assistant but it doesn't need to be a general personal assistant. It just has to be a research assistant because it just has to be a PowerPoint assistant organization. It's just like there's no use case for it."

---

#### Pain Point 7: Developer vs. Consumer Positioning Gap
**Description:** MCP sits awkwardly between being a developer tool (which devs will build themselves) and an enterprise vendor solution (where vendors should build it themselves).

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "And then it's also hard to put into the entry price perspective because who am I now? So it's the third enterprise now vendor. The vendor. The Tigong. The MCP level on top of. Doesn't make sense for middleware to do that and then. But what makes sense is actually the vendor needs to like do it."

### Key Strategic Insights

#### Insight 1: Spec-Driven vs. Natural Language Automation
William advocates strongly for **spec-driven development** for production automation workflows where reliability matters:
> "Spec driven development clock code sub agent do something like maybe in the future it's not even. It's not even code it's just like you just write a piece of natural language to ensure that the agent does this thing for you... the chances of failure for that particular action is still going to be like orders of magnitude higher than it was executed through code."

**Recommendation:** Balance both approaches - natural language for flexible, low-stakes tasks; spec-driven code for high-reliability, repetitive workflows.

---

#### Insight 2: Entertainment Integration as Breakthrough Moment
William predicts MCP will gain mainstream traction when integrated with dopamine-driven entertainment platforms:
> "So when MCP is combined with entertainment. That's when the big blow up will happen... Just compete for attention... billboard everything like all the slogan like that's how you win."

**Recommendation:** Consider partnerships with entertainment, gaming, or social platforms where agent-driven personalization adds immediate, addictive value.

---

#### Insight 3: Ecosystem Maturity Takes 10+ Years
References to integration middleware like Postman taking a decade to reach IPO:
> "It was a 10 year journey for him like before he actually got to got to the IPO and the exit and everything now that's it... It's I don't know... Yeah it's not necessarily who's the first. One being in your wrist."

**Recommendation:** Prepare for marathon, not sprint. Focus on psychological endurance and incremental ecosystem wins.

---

#### Insight 4: Build Apps That Make Jobs Easier, Not Inspire People
Clear positioning advice on what types of agent apps succeed:
> "Okay everything eventually if you are not a vendor... Just focusing on 17 everything is like improving human will not work out. Yeah yeah but. But yeah it's yeah it's well don't do app to inspire people. It never work out people is doing the job and make it job easier. Then that will work out. But inspire people. No, never."

**Recommendation:** Focus on practical workflow automation with measurable ROI, not motivational or self-improvement angles.

### Action Items

**Yusheng Kuo:**
- Obtain real user feedback to evaluate product-market fit honestly, disregarding sunk costs
- Decide whether to continue MCP focus or pivot to vertical agent applications
- Consider shift from pure middleware to specific use-case implementations

**William Lee:**
- Brainstorm perpetual prediction market product concept
- Share additional feedback on materials and strategy
- Continue internal MCP gateway dogfooding to drive adoption

### Summary

This strategic discussion with William Lee (AIPO Labs co-founder) revealed critical challenges in building MCP as a standalone middleware business. The core problem is **impossible ROI attribution** - when productivity improves, everyone claims credit, making middleware value invisible. MCP faces a **"tarpit phase"** requiring 10+ years of ecosystem maturity before commercial viability.

**Key takeaway:** MCP works better as vendor-integrated infrastructure than standalone product. Mainstream traction will come from entertainment/dopamine-driven platforms, not developer tools. The path forward requires either (1) patience for ecosystem maturation, or (2) pivot to vertical agent applications solving concrete job-to-be-done problems with measurable ROI.

William emphasized that successful agent apps make jobs easier with clear value, not inspirational promises. His strong recommendation: focus on specific, narrow use cases with reusable components rather than broad platform ambitions.
