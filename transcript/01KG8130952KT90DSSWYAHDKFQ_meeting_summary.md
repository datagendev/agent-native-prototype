**Duration:** 62 minutes

## Prospect Profile

## Pain Points

### Pain Point 1: Manual, Repetitive Work in Client Onboarding
**Description:** Andrew performs the same multi-step analysis process manually for every new client, which is time-consuming and doesn't scale as they take on more clients.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "So we process the call. So and like what happens manually is we take the kickoff called the client. Then I sit there, I look at the kickoff call transcripts, I look at the intake form and from that I begin to think to myself, okay, like how am I going to go about, like what companies are we, what companies are we going to go after?"

> "So that's kind of my process... So all of these skills are all things that I do manually for each client. So I just want, I'm just trying to turn it into skills so whenever we onboard a new client it can just go and do all of this work for me."

### Pain Point 2: Getting from Zero to One Takes Too Long
**Description:** The initial setup and strategy phase for each client campaign takes significant time, and Andrew wants to accelerate this by leveraging his best practices automatically.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "So my whole aim is like literally bro, we do a kickoff call of a client, the calls transcribed and straight away like Claude co can start working away and like suggesting yeah different like campaign angles based off of my best practices."

> "And just get me from zero, get me from zero to one a lot quicker."

### Pain Point 3: Difficulty Spending Time on Research During the Week
**Description:** The week is too busy with client work to research new tools and approaches, forcing Andrew to use weekends for improvement activities.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "Just doing some like research because it's quite hard to like spend time researching new things during the week. So I like to give myself the weekend to do some research into like new tools that I can use and things like that."

### Pain Point 4: Limited Understanding of Agent Architecture in Claude Code
**Description:** Andrew is familiar with skills but confused about when to use agents vs skills, sub-agents, and how to structure his workflows for maximum efficiency.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "I use the slash skills quite a lot. But I don't really use the slash agents much. And my question to you is like where should I be using it? Because it seems like you have agents and the agents have skills."

> "And then also I hear people talking about they spin up sub agents and this agents do the work in its own context window. All of this and that. Yeah, I'm trying to understand all of that stuff."

### Pain Point 5: Need for Team-Wide Deployment of Workflows
**Description:** Andrew's workflows are currently limited to his local Claude Code instance, but multiple team members conduct kickoff calls and would benefit from standardized processes.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "Because probably not just you doing this kickoff meeting, right? Once you've been deployed, like everyone will just use the same agent. So everyone finish their report, they will have the report like available to your notion data or like whatever you manage your data room."

(This was discussed as a solution, revealing the underlying pain point)

### Pain Point 6: Lack of Automation Triggers
**Description:** Andrew currently has to manually initiate his Claude Code workflows, but wants them to trigger automatically based on events (like completed kickoff calls).

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "So my whole aim is like literally bro, we do a kickoff call of a client, the calls transcribed and straight away like Claude co can start working away"

(Andrew expressed this as a desired state, indicating current manual triggering is a pain point)

## Summary

Andrew is a technically-savvy GTM strategist at a B2B agency who has successfully built Claude Code skills to automate portions of his client onboarding workflow. His main challenges are: (1) the manual, repetitive nature of analyzing each new client despite having skills, (2) not understanding how to architect his workflows using agents for end-to-end automation, and (3) inability to deploy these workflows for his team or trigger them automatically. He's specifically looking to move from manually running individual skills to having automated agent-based workflows that can run without his intervention after a kickoff call completes.
