## Their Reply
> Hey, no worries. Thursday doesn't work but I selected a time on Friday!

*Context: This was in response to Yu-Sheng requesting to reschedule from Tuesday to Thursday due to product dev issues*

## Draft Reply

**Option A - Confirm & Prep (Recommended)**
```
Perfect! Looking forward to it on Friday.

Just to prep - I'll walk you through the agent-native-prototype setup we discussed. It's designed to make Claude Code work more like Clay but entirely in your terminal (slash commands, table ops, enrichment workflows).

Any specific GTM workflow you'd like to build together during the call? Happy to tailor the demo.
```

**Option B - Shorter Confirmation**
```
Perfect! See you Friday. Looking forward to showing you the agent-native setup.
```

**Option C - No Reply Needed**
The last message ("Thanks!") from Yu-Sheng adequately closed the exchange. A reply here might be unnecessary unless you want to add value before the meeting.

## Reasoning

**Context Analysis:**
- This is a scheduling confirmation exchange - David confirmed Friday works after Thursday didn't
- Yu-Sheng already acknowledged with "Thanks!"
- Meeting is 2 days away (Jan 24, Friday)
- Strong existing rapport (3 previous sessions, active usage)
- David is a highly engaged lead who's already paying customer

**Recommendation: Option A**
While Option C (no reply) is perfectly acceptable, Option A adds value by:
1. Confirming the meeting (good practice)
2. Setting expectations for what will be covered
3. Inviting David to come prepared with a specific use case
4. Demonstrating thoughtfulness about tailoring to his needs

This matches David's profile as someone who's deeply engaged, technical, and has specific goals (context systems for GTM clients). The question about his workflow opens a dialogue that could make Friday's session more productive.

**Tone Justification:**
- Professional but warm (matches previous exchanges)
- Action-oriented (David is a doer - "paying for extra limits," wants to build systems)
- Collaborative ("build together") rather than instructional
- Respects his expertise (Clay Partner who understands GTM systems)

**Avoid:**
- Being overly enthusiastic (he's already committed)
- Repeating info he knows (he's seen the repo link)
- Generic meeting reminders (he booked it himself)
