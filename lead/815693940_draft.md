## Lead Context
- **Name**: Andriy Vovchak
- **Title**: GTM Engineer
- **Company**: Avokaado
- **Location**: Tallinn Metropolitan Area
- **Email**: theandriyvy@gmail.com

## Conversation Summary
Long-term engaged conversation (100+ messages) about Claude Code, MCP tools, and automation. Andriy is highly technical and has been actively building with Claude Code. Recently discussed webhook deployment challenges - he mentioned only knowing Railway.app and Vercel as options for deploying Claude Code agents with webhooks. Yu-Sheng offered early access to a new webhook deployment feature that connects repos to deploy Claude subagents with one click.

## Draft Reply

Perfect timing! I just put together a quick doc that walks through the webhook deployment setup: https://datagen.mintlify.app/agents

It shows how to connect your repo and deploy subagents with webhooks in literally one click - no Railway or Vercel needed. The goal is to make it dead simple to trigger your Claude Code workflows from Clay, HeyReach, or any external system.

Would love to jump on a call this week to walk through it with you and get your feedback on what's working/not working. You'd be one of the first to test this, so your input would be invaluable. When works for you?

## Reasoning

**Context Analysis:**
- Andriy is HIGHLY interested (all caps "PLEASE LET'S CATCH UP", "send all you have")
- He has a specific pain point: connecting external systems (Clay) to Claude Code via webhooks
- He thought Railway.app was the only solution and was unhappy with it ("worst, Vercel!")
- He's technically sophisticated enough to test and provide valuable feedback
- Long relationship with lots of back-and-forth (100+ messages)

**Reply Strategy:**
1. **Immediate value**: Lead with the documentation link he can access right now
2. **Address his pain directly**: Emphasize "no Railway or Vercel needed" since that was his complaint
3. **Connect to his use case**: Mention Clay explicitly since he mentioned "I wanted to connect Clay and Claude code"
4. **Clear CTA**: Offer to walk through it personally and ask for specific availability
5. **Make him feel valued**: Position him as "one of the first to test this" to emphasize the exclusivity

**Tone:**
- Enthusiastic but not overeager (matching his energy)
- Technical and specific (he's a GTM Engineer building on Claude Code)
- Conversational continuation of existing rapport (they've met before, have ongoing dialogue)
- Focus on solving his specific problem rather than generic pitch
