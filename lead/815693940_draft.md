## Lead Context
- **Name**: Andriy Vovchak
- **Title**: GTM Engineer
- **Company**: Avokaado
- **Location**: Tallinn Metropolitan Area
- **Summary**: 70% faster contract turnaround for Sales, Procurement, Legal & HR - solving Legal Chaos with a next-gen AI Contracting tool @Avokaado.io
- **Tags**: GTM engineer (List: 331113)

## Conversation Summary
Andriy has sent three rapid-fire messages showing high interest and urgency:
1. "PLEASE LET'S CATCH UP ON THIS" (caps indicate strong interest)
2. "send all you have" (wants comprehensive information)
3. "I wanted to connect Clay and Claude code, but railway seemed to be the only possible solution. I'm happy I'm wrong" (reveals technical context and pain point)

**Key Insights**:
- He's been exploring Clay + Claude Code integration
- Currently thinks Railway is the only solution
- Excited to learn there might be alternatives
- This is exactly the DataGen use case (agent-native workflows, tool orchestration)

## Draft Reply

Hey Andriy!

You're absolutely right to be excited - DataGen is built specifically for this. Instead of Railway's generic infra, we give you native Clay + Claude Code orchestration with Python-level control over the workflow.

Here's what I'll send over:
1. Quick demo video showing Clay → DataGen → enrichment pipeline
2. Template for your exact use case (contract data + AI processing)
3. Invite to our private workspace so you can test drive it

When works for a 15-min walkthrough? I can show you live how to replace your Railway setup with a single DataGen workflow.

## Reasoning

**Why this reply works**:

1. **Acknowledges his excitement**: "You're absolutely right to be excited" validates his enthusiasm
2. **Directly addresses his pain point**: Railway vs. DataGen positioning is clear and specific
3. **Speaks his language**: "Python-level control" resonates with a GTM Engineer who understands technical depth
4. **Provides concrete next steps**: 3 specific deliverables he asked for ("send all you have")
5. **Low-friction CTA**: 15-min walkthrough is easy to commit to
6. **Relevance to his business**: Contract data + AI processing connects to Avokaado's contracting platform
7. **Urgency without pushiness**: "When works" gives him control while maintaining momentum

**Tone**: Professional but energetic, matching his caps-lock enthusiasm. Technical enough to respect his engineering background but focused on outcomes.

**Strategic approach**: He's already convinced there's a solution and wants details immediately. Don't slow him down with discovery questions - give him the assets he requested and make scheduling the demo trivial.
