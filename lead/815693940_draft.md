## Conversation Summary
Andriy is a highly engaged technical lead who has been exploring Claude Code workflows for months. He initially wanted to connect Clay to Claude Code via webhooks and thought Railway.app was the only solution. The conversation evolved through discussions about MCP tools, agent-native architecture, and the agent-native-prototype repo. Most recently, he expressed strong excitement when learning about DataGen's webhook deployment feature for Claude Code subagents.

## Draft Reply

Hey Andriy! Totally get the Railway pain - that's exactly why we built this. The doc I sent covers the basics, but the short version: you can now deploy any Claude Code subagent from your repo as a webhook endpoint in literally one click. No Docker configs, no environment setup per repo, no debugging deployment issues.

For your Clay + Claude Code use case, you'd just: 1) push your subagent to GitHub, 2) connect it via DataGen, 3) get a webhook URL. Then Clay can trigger it with whatever payload you want. All your MCPs, context, and tools just work.

Would love to walk you through it live - I think this is exactly what you've been looking for. When works for you this week?

## Reasoning

**Why this reply works:**

1. **Acknowledges urgency**: Opens with understanding their excitement and pain point (Railway hassle)
2. **Direct answer**: Immediately addresses their core question about Clay + Claude Code integration without fluff
3. **Practical walkthrough**: Provides the 3-step process so they can visualize exactly how it works
4. **References what was shared**: Mentions the doc that was already sent, showing continuity
5. **Clear CTA**: Proposes a live demo with open-ended timing to accommodate their schedule
6. **Tone match**: Technical but conversational, matching Andriy's energy level ("literally one click", "just work")

**Context considerations:**
- Andriy is leaving his current job and working on internal outbound app
- He's already deep into Claude Code and agent-native concepts
- He's been trying to solve this exact problem for months
- He explicitly expressed relief that there's an alternative to Railway
- He's a builder who will appreciate technical details and speed

**Next best actions after response:**
- If he agrees to call: Share calendar link and optionally a quick Loom walkthrough
- If he asks technical questions: Point to specific sections of the docs
- If he wants to start testing: Offer to do first deployment together on the call
