# Claude Code Deployers ICP

## One-Liner

**People who have already built something in Claude Code and wish it could run without them.**

---

## Why This ICP

They've already:
- Crossed the Claude Code learning curve
- Believe in agentic AI (not skeptics)
- Built a working workflow worth automating
- Felt the pain of manual execution

They're not asking "what is Claude Code?" — they're asking "how do I make this run overnight?"

---

## Filtering Criteria

| Filter | Why it matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Already using Claude Code** | Past the learning curve, invested in the tool |
| **Non-developer role** | GTM, ops, marketing — business tasks, not coding |
| **Built a repeatable workflow** | Has something worth deploying |
| **Feels manual trigger pain** | Ready to pay for automation |

---

## Job Titles

**Primary:**
- Growth Marketing Manager
- RevOps / Marketing Ops
- Demand Gen Specialist
- GTM Lead / Head of Growth
- Founder / Solopreneur (doing own ops)

**Secondary:**
- Content Marketing Manager
- Sales Development Rep (using for prospecting)
- Customer Success (using for account research)
- FP&A / Finance Ops

---

## The Ceiling They've Hit

| Limitation | Pain |
|------------|------|
| **Session-bound** | Close laptop → agent stops |
| **Manual trigger** | Must type command each time |
| **No scheduling** | Can't run at 6am or "every Monday" |
| **No event triggers** | Can't fire on webhook/lead reply |
| **Local only** | Workflow lives on one machine |
| **No monitoring** | Failures go unnoticed |

---

## High-Intent Signals

**What they say:**
- "I run this every morning..."
- "I have to remember to trigger..."
- "Works great but I need to be at my laptop"
- "Wish I could schedule this"
- "How do I make this run overnight?"

**What they do:**
- Share multi-step workflow posts on LinkedIn
- Build/fork Claude Code skills on GitHub
- Ask about scheduling in Discord/communities
- Comment on Claude Code tutorials asking about persistence

---

## Workflow Signals

Look for mentions of:
- Lead enrichment pipelines
- Content generation workflows
- Reporting automation
- Ad creative generation
- Outbound personalization
- Data aggregation from multiple sources

Keywords: "pipeline," "workflow," "automation," "sequence," "batch"

---

## Who They Are NOT

| Exclude | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Pure developers building apps | Want SDKs, not deployment |
| "AI is cool" experimenters | No workflow to deploy yet |
| Enterprise IT buyers | Different sales motion |
| People asking "what is Claude Code?" | Too early in journey |

---

## The Qualifying Question

> **"What workflow have you built in Claude Code that you wish could run without you?"**

- Has an answer → ICP
- No answer → Not ready yet

---

## The Message That Resonates

Don't say: "Build AI agents"
Say: **"You built the agent. Now deploy it."**

Specific angles by persona:
- **GTM Operator**: "Your lead enrichment workflow? Run it automatically when leads hit your CRM"
- **Content Marketer**: "Your content audit? Schedule it weekly, get results in Slack"
- **Founder**: "Your research agent? Let it work while you sleep"
