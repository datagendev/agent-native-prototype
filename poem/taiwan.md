# Taiwan

Where mountain peaks pierce clouded skies,
And jade-green valleys softly rise,
An island jewel in the sea—
Taiwan, land of the brave and free.

The scent of night markets fills the air,
With bubble tea and street food fare,
Neon lights in Taipei glow,
While ancient temples whisper low.

From Taroko's marble canyon walls,
To Sun Moon Lake where beauty calls,
Cherry blossoms paint the spring,
While ocean waves their song do sing.

Through typhoons fierce and earthquakes' shake,
A resilient spirit none can break,
Where east meets west in harmony,
Democracy blooms wild and free.

In semiconductor's gleaming halls,
Where innovation never stalls,
Yet still the old traditions stay—
Respect for elders lights the way.

Oh Formosa, beautiful isle,
Where strangers greet you with a smile,
In your heart beats strong and true,
A spirit bright in morning dew.

From Keelung's rain to Kenting's sun,
Many cultures merged as one,
Taiwan, precious and sublime,
Standing proud throughout all time.
