# Taiwan

Jewel of the Pacific, where mountains meet the sea,
Taiwan stands resilient, wild and free.
From Taipei's glowing towers to Taroko's carved stone,
A tapestry of beauty, uniquely your own.

Jade peaks pierce clouds in morning's gentle light,
While night markets dance with flavors bright.
Tea leaves whisper on Alishan's misty heights,
As cherry blossoms herald spring's delights.

East coast cliffs where turquoise waters crash,
Rice paddies shimmer in the sunset's splash.
Ancient temples guard traditions old and true,
While innovation blooms in everything you do.

Island of contrasts, modern yet serene,
The warmest hearts that I have ever seen.
In every street, in every friendly face,
Taiwan shines—a truly special place.

Through storms you've weathered, standing tall and strong,
Your spirit echoes in every song.
Beautiful island, may your light never fade,
A testament to all the dreams you've made.
