# Portland, Oregon

Where mountains meet the morning mist,
And rivers weave through emerald green,
A city of bridges, rain-kissed,
The City of Roses, evergreen.

Coffee shops on every corner stand,
Where bearded souls with laptops dwell,
Food carts serve from every land,
And craft beer flows where stories tell.

Mount Hood watches, silent, white,
Above the streets of old and new,
While Powell's books hold knowledge tight,
In aisles that stretch beyond the view.

The rain comes gentle, soft, and long,
It paints the streets in silver sheen,
But Portlanders just carry on,
Embracing gray between the green.

From Forest Park's cathedral trees,
To Hawthorne's quirky, vibrant soul,
The spirit here flows wild and free,
Where weird is not a flaw, but whole.

Keep Portland weird, the saying goes,
And weird it stays with joy and pride,
Where creativity forever flows,
And dreamers find a place to bide.

So here's to you, dear PDX,
With all your rain and all your grace,
Your coffee, bikes, and flannel dress,
Your unmistakable embrace.
