Bella Italia

Where azure waves kiss sun-bleached stone,
And ancient Rome still guards her throne,
Where cypress trees stand tall and proud,
And church bells sing above the crowd.

In Venice, gondolas gently glide
Through liquid streets at evening tide,
While Florence holds the artist's dream,
Where Michelangelo's visions gleam.

The Tuscan hills roll gold and green,
The finest vineyards ever seen,
Where olive groves in silver shine,
And terraced slopes give birth to wine.

From Alps that touch the northern sky,
To Sicily where lemons lie,
Each cobbled street, each piazza square,
Holds centuries of love and care.

The aroma of espresso strong,
The opera's passionate song,
Fresh pasta, basil, ripe tomatoes red,
And crusty, warm, fresh-baked bread.

Oh Italy, land of the heart,
Where life itself becomes an art,
Where history and beauty blend,
A romance that shall never end.
