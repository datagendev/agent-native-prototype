# Seattle

Emerald city draped in mist and rain,
Where coffee steams on every corner street,
The Space Needle pierces clouds again,
And Puget Sound reflects the sky's gray sheet.

Mount Rainier stands sentinel and grand,
A snowy guardian watching from afar,
While ferries glide across the water strand,
Beneath the bridges where the barges are.

Pike Place vendors call their fresh caught fish,
The gum wall gleams with colors bright and strange,
Tech giants rise where old warehouses swish,
A city caught between the old and change.

In summer's brief and golden sunny days,
The hills come alive with music, art, and cheer,
But autumn brings the silver misty haze,
That makes this Northwestern jewel so dear.

Seattle, with your evergreens so tall,
Your grunge and grace, your rain and coffee steam,
You captured hearts and welcomed one and all,
A city more than real—a living dream.
