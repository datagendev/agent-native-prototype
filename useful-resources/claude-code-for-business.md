# Claude Code for Business - Run Your Company with AI Team

**Author:** Franki T
**Source:** francescatabor.com

## Four Strategic Pillars

Framework for deploying Claude Code across business functions:

1. **Attract** - Generating leads and marketing content
2. **Convert** - Automating sales outreach and proposal generation
3. **Retain** - Managing customer success and support documentation
4. **Ascend** - Identifying upsell opportunities and new product development ideas

## Specialized Agent Examples

Deploy domain-specific AI workers:

| Agent | Function |
|-------|----------|
| **HR Agent** | Handles policy questions and employee-related tasks |
| **Content Agent** | Manages marketing copy and communication materials |
| **Security Agent** | Performs code review and security validation |
| **Log-Analysis Agents** | Diagnose system outages by processing microservice logs in parallel |

## Automation Patterns

### Parallel Task Execution
Rather than sequential processing, Claude Code can "simultaneously spin up specialized Sub-Agents" to tackle independent subtasks concurrently, dramatically reducing project completion time.

### External System Integration
Use APIs and Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect Claude Code with business tools like Salesforce:
- Automatically log new leads into CRM
- Trigger workflows from external events
- Sync data across systems

### Plan-Before-Execute
"Plan Mode" enforces a read-only analysis phase where the AI formulates comprehensive strategies for human review before implementation begins.

## Knowledge Management

The `.code.md` file serves as persistent organizational memory:
- Company mission
- Tone of voice
- Brand guidelines
- Data structure conventions
- Security rules

Accessible across all sessions.

## Key Insight

Claude Code positioned not merely as a coding assistant, but as a powerful platform designed to run an entire company through specialized, coordinated agents.
