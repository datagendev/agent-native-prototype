# 10 Claude Code Use Cases for GTM

**Author:** Maja Voje (with Matteo Tittarelli)

## Core Premise

Organizations leak GTM context quarterly, forcing teams to restart and new hires to ramp slowly. The solution involves using Claude Code to engineer custom skills encoding company frameworks, ICPs, and positioning.

## The 10 Use Cases

### 1. Context Before Content
Generate ICP research, win/loss patterns, competitor analysis, and brand guidelines from company URL as foundation.

### 2. Product Marketing Foundations
Create positioning, messaging, and value props coded permanently (not lost in forgotten documents).

### 3. Dynamic Sales Call Updates
Single transcript refresh ICP docs, battlecards, objection library, and content calendars automatically.

### 4. Pattern Detection
Identify real win/loss reasons across 50+ calls versus relying on incomplete sales memory.

### 5. Living Objection Library
New objections auto-captured, categorized, and integrated into response frameworks.

### 6. Evolving Battle Cards
Competitor mentions trigger automatic research updates.

### 7. Content Generation
Customer language converts to LinkedIn posts, case studies, and landing copy.

### 8. Workflow Automation
Repetitive GTM tasks become automated Clay tables and n8n flows.

### 9. Accelerated Onboarding
New hires access synthesized GTM context day one; no 90-day ramp.

### 10. GTM Query Engine
"What objections affect enterprise deals?" answered instantly with sources.

## Vision

Transform from tribal knowledge and scattered documentation to compounding organizational insight.
