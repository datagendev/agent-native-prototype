## Improvements - Company Domain Extraction
- Problem: web_research was unreliable for extracting company websites
- Solution: Replaced with firecrawl_scrape + extract_structured
- Method:
  1. Scrape YC company page directly with Firecrawl (48h cache)
  2. Extract founder info + company website from markdown
  3. Clean domain (remove protocol, www, paths)
- Test: Telemetron AI → telemetron.ai ✓
- Benefits: Faster, cheaper, more reliable domain extraction
- Next: Re-run enrichment to get accurate domains for all B2B companies
