Learn how to properly setup the context foundation for GTM and what kind of context connector makes sense. Not sure if you are familiar with MCP, and maybe Claude Code, but we want to offer you our expertise in MCP setup, (our) best practices in Claude Code, and can even help to build MCP you need if not available at the moment. All free, just try to learn what kind of MCPs makes sense and can readily boost the productivity.  \n\nThanks, \nYusheng",

You keep the same OOH stack and sales process, and the gateway simply turns it into a single, inspectable surface your team can query from Claude.\n\nIf this sounds useful, we can walk through which MCP connectors would actually help Universal and help you get them set up inside one gateway tool.\n\nBest,\nYusheng",
